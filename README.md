A Bibliometric and Scientometric python library that uses the .bib file generated by the Scopus or WOS (Web of Science) scientific databases. 

General Capabilities:
- a) Works with **Scopus** or **WOS** .bib files
- b) Identification and Removal of duplicates
- c) Generates an **EDA** (Exploratory Data Analysis) Report: Publications Timespan, Total Number of Countries, Total Number of Institutions, Total Number of Sources, Total Number of References, Total Number of Languages (and also the number of docs for each language), Total Number of Documents, Average Documents per Author, Average Documents per Institution, Average Documents per Source, Average Documents per Year, Total Number of Authors, Total Number of Authors Keywords, Total Number of Authors Keywords Plus, Total Single-Authored Documents, Total Multi-Authored Documents, Average Collaboration Index, Max H-Index, Total Number of Citations, Average Citations per Author, Average Citations per Institution, Average Citations per Document, Average Citations per Source
- d) Creates an **ID** (Identification) for each Document, Authors, Sources, Institutions, Countries, Authors' Keywords, Keywords Plus. The IDs can be used in graphs/plots to obtain a cleaner visualization
- e) Creates a **WordCloud** from the Abstracts, Titles, Authors Keywords or Keywords Plus
- f) Creates a **Projection** of the documents based on the Abstracts, Titles, Authors Keywords or Keywords Plus
- g) Creates a **Evolution Plot** based on Abstracts, Titles, Sources, Authors Keywords or Keywords Plus
- h) Creates a **Sankey Plot** (An interactive plot) with any combination of the following keys: Authors, Countries, Institutions, Journals, Auhors_Keywords, Keywords_Plus, and/or Languages
- i) Creates a **TreeMap** from the Authors, Countries, Institutions, Journals, Auhors_Keywords, or Keywords_Plus
- j) Creates an **Authors Productivity Plot** (An interactive plot) It informs for each year the documents (IDs) published for each author

- b) **Collaboration Analysis** between Authors, Countries, Institutions or **Adjacency Analysis**between Authors' Keywords or Keywords Plus.  (An interactive plot). Collaboration and Adjacency can be highlighted for better visualization
- c) **Similarity Analysis** can be performed using coupling or cocitation methods. (An interactive plot).
- d) **World MAP Collaboration Analysis** between Countries in a Map

Correction and Manipulation Capabilities:
- a) Filter the .bib file by Year, Sources, Bradford Law Cores, Countries, and/or Languages
- b) Merge Authors, Institutions, Countries, Languages and/or Sources that have multiple entries
