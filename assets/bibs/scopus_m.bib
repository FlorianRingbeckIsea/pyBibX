	abstract = {Design concept evaluation is a huge challenge in the R&D stage of new product development. The information in the assessments often depends on the decision-makers' individual preferences. However, sometimes the decision-makers cannot give precise and complete information because it is very difficult for them to be familiar with all the criteria. In this situation, an incomplete information decision-making matrix is established. In this paper, decision-making methods based on incomplete information are compared in the literature review. Incomplete information determination method using trust mechanism is proved as a proper way to solve this problem, and the missing information are computed based on the alternatives However, in design concept evaluation, experts commonly provide their preferences using linguistic words according to the different attributes. Hence, we propose a three-step Multiple Attributes Group Decision-making (MAGDM) method where the missing value are determined by attributes. In step one, a data repairing method is proposed based on trust theory. After that, in step two, a comprehensive weight determination method combining AHP and entropy is proposed to obtain the weight of index attributes. Finally, the Rough-TOPSIS method is applied in the design scheme ranking step. In the case study, the proposed method is implemented in a tourism product design process to show its effectiveness. © 2022 Chen et al.

Trustworthiness evaluation has become increasingly vital for software production and its permission being used in industry. However, trustworthiness evaluation is challenging due to the absence of comprehensive models, systematic methods, and efficient tools. We present iTrustEval a framework for software trustworthiness evaluation with an intelligent analytic hierarchy process (AHP)based method. In iTrustEval an extensible trustworthiness model enabling on-demand integration with industrial trustworthy standards (such as ISO 25010 and Automotive SPICE in the current model) is proposed; an AHP based method is designed for the bottom-up measuring data fusion (where a hybrid missing-value recommendation engine is developed using both temporal-attenuation-mechanism based history data recommendation and matrix factorisation-based recommender system); and a prototypical tool has been developed. The applicability of iTrustEval is validated through a case study, and the results show it is sound in efficiency and effectiveness.  © 2022 IEEE.},

In this article, we prove that connecting path method (CPM), which is a well-known approach of estimating missing judgments, also guarantees minimal geometric consistency index, and only involves elementary connecting paths by unraveling its connection with logarithmic least square method. The formal proofs suggest that CPM alone is sufficient to fix both missing judgments and inconsistency of PCM in AHP. Based on this well grounded merit, a procedure is proposed to improve consistency for incomplete PCM. The validity of the proposed procedure is illustrated by classical examples, and its advantages over other consistency improving approaches are also discussed in detail. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new method to coping with group decision making with incomplete fuzzy preference information. To do this, it first defines an additively consistent index of fuzzy preference relations, and then gives a method to calculating the priority vector for additively consistent fuzzy preference relations. When the individual fuzzy preference relation is incomplete, a goal programming model is constructed, by which the missing values can be obtained. Then, an iterative approach to obtain the acceptably additive consistency of fuzzy preference relations is introduced. After that, an induced hybrid weighted aggregation (IHWA) operator is presented to aggregate the collective fuzzy preference relation. The main features of this aggregation operator are that the group consistency is no smaller than the highest individual inconsistency, and the group consensus is no smaller than the smallest consensus between the individual fuzzy preference relations. As a series of development, an algorithm based on the acceptable consistency and the group consensus is developed. Finally, three examples are given to show the efficiency and feasibility of the developed procedure, and comparisons are also offered. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Within the framework of the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process, the importance of alternatives could be expressed as interval-valued comparison matrices to model some uncertainty experienced by decision makers (DMs). Owing to the complexity of the considered problem and the lack of DMs’ knowledge, the given interval-valued comparison matrix may be incomplete. It is of importance to develop mathematical models for incomplete interval-valued comparison matrices, so that the missing entries can be estimated. In this study, it is considered that a missing value may be one of the bounds of interval-valued entries. Acceptable incomplete interval additive reciprocal preference relations (IARPRs) are redefined and the existing drawback is overcome. By considering the random behavior of decision makers in comparing alternatives, the novel definitions of multiplicative and additive approximate consistency for incomplete IARPRs are introduced. Then, we propose two goal programming models to estimate the missing values of incomplete IARPRs. The permutations of alternatives are incorporated into the proposed mathematical models. It is found that when the permutations of alternatives are different, the estimated preference values could be different. Some numerical results are reported to illustrate the given algorithms for solving decision-making problems with incomplete IARPRs. The observations reveal that the proposed mathematical models can be used to capture the randomness experienced by decision makers in comparing alternatives. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {There is inherent ambiguity when comparing decision criteria in multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM). A fuzzy Borda count was developed to take into account some of the ambiguity and derive criteria weights by linguistically comparing decision criteria. This study extends the fuzzy Borda count to take into account agents' confidence in their preferences for criteria weights. The procedure is applied to prioritize agricultural lands for conservation buffer placement using multiple criteria in the Raritan River Basin in New Jersey. These criteria, which include soil erodibility, hydrological sensitivity, wildlife habitat, and impervious surface, capture the conservation buffers' ecosystem services in terms of reducing soil erosion, controlling runoff generation, enhancing wildlife habitat, and mitigating stormwater impacts, respectively. A survey was conducted of conservation professionals including federal employees at NRCS, state and local agencies and nongovernmental environmental organizations to elicit agents' preferences for multiple benefits of conservation buffers using a fuzzy pairwise comparison method. The study compares the fuzzy MCDM procedure to a class-based MCDM procedure for prioritizing agricultural lands for conservation buffer placement. The comparative results show that both procedures have their advantages and disadvantages, but generate comparable prioritization results. Further research is needed to improve the proposed fuzzy MCDM procedure to handle missing values in eliciting agents' preferences for comparing multiple criteria. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

However, it is unsuitable to deal with the multi-attribute decision making with incomplete information, especially the attributes with missing values. In this paper, a new method for multiple-attribute decision making based on ER-AHP has been proposed, which incorporates the Evidential Reasoning(ER) algorithm with AHP. Firstly, each alternative is compared with the negative ideal alternative under an attribute to form the decision table by experts. Then a new basic probability assignment function (BPA) is constructed to express the incomplete information and some properties of the function are proved. After then, based on the results of aggregation which combines the attributes of each alternative by the ER algorithm, the alternatives are sorted and selected. Finally, the ER-AHP is compared with the DS / AHP through a numerical example. © 2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Employee selection is an essential process that in many organizations depends only on human judgement, and in today’s fast-changing work environment, is susceptible to human errors. Hence, the problem of selecting the most appropriate employee is complex and costly, especially if the selected employee is unsuitable for the job position. The complexity of the problem arises from several requirements: each job position requires more than one criterion to be fulfilled by the job candidate; each candidate has a different set of skills, and usually, several candidates apply to one job position. The decision-maker has to make a quick selection decision, as the longer employee selection process is, the greater the costs are. In this article, we build 20 decision support models for four different job positions with five Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods and we compare them on a real set of data from an employment agency. The goal of this comparison is to recommend which method is most suitable by comparing the correctness of the results, ranking with missing values and difficulty to use. The results show which MCDM method is better for filtering most suitable employees given all required criteria and which MCDM method would be recommendable for employees ranking. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

As the number of criteria of an AHP increases, the number of elements of the pairwise matrix increases quadratically. This forces an expert to answer a large number of comparisons. This paper studies and analyzes the characteristics of a pairwise matrix when one of its elements is not available. This is one of the efforts to reduce the number of comparisons that need to be provided by an expert. The results show that a complete pairwise matrix that is consistent tends to have the same characteristics (priority sequence and consistency index) as when it has one missing value. Further research is needed so that the number of comparisons can be decreased while still keeping the pairwise matrix consistent. © IJTech 2017.},

	abstract = {This study reviews the common practices and procedures conducted to identify the cost drivers that the past literature has classified into two main categories: qualitative and quantitative procedures. In addition, the study reviews different computational intelligence (CI) techniques and ensemble methods conducted to develop practical cost prediction models. This study discusses the hybridization of these modeling techniques and the future trends for cost model development, limitations, and recommendations. The study focuses on reviewing the most common artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for cost modeling such as fuzzy logic (FL) models, artificial neural networks (ANNs), regression models, case-based reasoning (CBR), hybrid models, diction tree (DT), random forest (RF), supportive vector machine (SVM), AdaBoost, scalable boosting trees (XGBoost), and evolutionary computing (EC) such as genetic algorithm (GA). Moreover, this paper provides the comprehensive knowledge needed to develop a reliable parametric cost model at the conceptual stage of the project. Additionally, field canals improvement projects (FCIPs) are used as an actual case study to analyze the performance of the ML models. Out of 20 AI techniques, the results showed that the most accurate and suitable method is XGBoost with 9.091% and 0.929 based on mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and adjusted R2, respectively. Nonlinear adaptability, handling missing values and outliers, model interpretation, and uncertainty are discussed for the 20 developed AI models. In addition, this study presents a publicly open data set for FCIPs to be used for future model validation and analysis. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {With trending competition in decision-making process, linguistic decision-making is gaining attractive attention. Previous studies on linguistic decision-making have neglected the occurring probability (relative importance) of each linguistic term which causes unreasonable ranking of objects. Further, decision-makers' (DMs) often face difficulties in providing apt preference information for evaluation. Motivated by these challenges, in this paper, we set our proposal on probabilistic linguistic preference relation (PLPR)-based decision framework. The framework consists of two phases viz., (a) missing value entry phase and (b) ranking phase. In phase (a), the missing values of PLPR are filled using a newly proposed automatic procedure and consistency of PLPR is ensured using a consistency check and repair mechanism. Following this, in phase (b), objects are ranked using newly proposed analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method under PLPR context. The practicality of the proposal is validated by using two numerical examples viz., green supplier selection problem for healthcare and the automobile industry. Finally, the strength and weakness of the proposal are discussed by comparing with similar methods. © 2018 by the authors.},

Firstly, considering the time effect of student scoring, the recommendation model is transformed into Markov decision process. Then, by combining the collaborative filtering algorithm with reinforcing learning rewards and punishments, an optimization model of student scoring based on timestamp information is constructed. To quantify the degree of students' preference for courses, the analytic hierarchy process is used to convert the students' behavior data into the preference value of courses. To solve the problem of data scarcity, the missing values are predicted by the prediction score rounding filling and the optimization boundary completion method. Experimental results show that the feasibility of the proposed system is verified, and the system has vital accuracy and convergence performance. The ideological and political education recommendation system proposed in this paper has important reference significance for promoting ideological and political education in the era of big data.

	abstract = {Selecting relevant features to make a decision and expressing the relationships between these features is not a simple task. The decision maker must precisely define the alternatives and criteria which are more important for the decision making process. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) uses hierarchical structures to facilitate this process. The comparison is realized using pairwise matrices, which are filled in according to the decision maker judgments. Subsequently, matrix consistency is tested and priorities are obtained by calculating the matrix principal eigenvector. Given an incomplete pairwise matrix, two procedures must be performed: first, it must be completed with suitable values for the missing entries and, second, the matrix must be improved until a satisfactory level of consistency is reached. Several methods are used to fill in missing entries for incomplete pairwise matrices with correct comparison values. Additionally, once pairwise matrices are complete and if comparison judgments between pairs are not consistent, some methods must be used to improve the matrix consistency and, therefore, to obtain coherent results. In this paper a model based on the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network is presented. Given an AHP pairwise matrix, this model is capable of completing missing values and improving the matrix consistency at the same time. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},
