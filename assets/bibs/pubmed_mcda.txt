PG  - 1558-65

AB  - BACKGROUND: Proper assessment of the harms caused by the misuse of drugs can 
      inform policy makers in health, policing, and social care. We aimed to apply 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) modelling to a range of drug harms in the 
      UK. METHODS: Members of the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs, including 
      two invited specialists, met in a 1-day interactive workshop to score 20 drugs on 
      16 criteria: nine related to the harms that a drug produces in the individual and 
      seven to the harms to others. Drugs were scored out of 100 points, and the 
      criteria were weighted to indicate their relative importance. FINDINGS: MCDA 
      modelling showed that heroin, crack cocaine, and metamfetamine were the most 
      harmful drugs to individuals (part scores 34, 37, and 32, respectively), whereas 
      alcohol, heroin, and crack cocaine were the most harmful to others (46, 21, and 
      17, respectively). Overall, alcohol was the most harmful drug (overall harm score 
      72), with heroin (55) and crack cocaine (54) in second and third places. 
      INTERPRETATION: These findings lend support to previous work assessing drug 
      harms, and show how the improved scoring and weighting approach of MCDA increases 
      the differentiation between the most and least harmful drugs. However, the 
      findings correlate poorly with present UK drug classification, which is not based 
      simply on considerations of harm. FUNDING: Centre for Crime and Justice Studies

TI  - Development of a Glucocorticoid Toxicity Index (GTI) using multicriteria decision 
      analysis.
PG  - 543-546
LID - 10.1136/annrheumdis-2016-210002 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop a Glucocorticoid Toxicity Index (GTI) to assess 
      glucocorticoid (GC)-related morbidity and GC-sparing ability of other therapies. 
      METHODS: Nineteen experts on GC use and outcome measures from 11 subspecialties 
      participated. Ten experts were from the USA; nine from Canada, Europe or 
      Australia. Group consensus methods and multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) 
      were used. A Composite GTI and Specific List comprise the overall GTI. The 
      Composite GTI reflects toxicity likely to change during a clinical trial. The 
      Composite GTI toxicities occur commonly, vary with GC exposure, and are weighted 
      and scored. Relative weights for items in the Composite GTI were derived by group 
      consensus and MCDA. The Specific List is designed to capture GC toxicity not 
      included in the Composite GTI. The Composite GTI was evaluated by application to 
      paper cases by the investigators and an external group of 17 subspecialists. 
      RESULTS: Thirty-one toxicity items were included in the Composite GTI and 23 in 
      the Specific List. Composite GTI evaluation showed high inter-rater agreement 
      (investigators κ 0.88, external raters κ 0.90). To assess the degree to which the 
      Composite GTI corresponds to expert clinical judgement, participants ranked 15 
      cases by clinical judgement in order of highest to lowest GC toxicity. Expert 
      rankings were then compared with case ranking by the Composite GTI, yielding 
      excellent agreement (investigators weighted κ 0.87, external raters weighted κ 
      0.77). CONCLUSIONS: We describe the development and initial evaluation of a 
      comprehensive instrument for the assessment of GC toxicity.

TI  - Multicriteria decision analysis in oncology.
PG  - 1812-26
LID - 10.1111/hex.12178 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been a growing interest in the development and application 
      of alternative decision-making frameworks within health care, including 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA). Even though the literature includes 
      several reviews on MCDA methods, applications of MCDA in oncology are lacking. 
      AIM: The aim of this paper is to discuss a rationale for the use of MCDA in 
      oncology. In this context, the following research question emerged: How can MCDA 
      be used to develop a clinical decision support tool in oncology? METHODS: In this 
      paper, a brief background on decision making is presented, followed by an 
      overview of MCDA methods and process. The paper discusses some applications of 
      MCDA, proposes research opportunities in the context of oncology and presents an 
      illustrative example of how MCDA can be applied to oncology. FINDINGS: Decisions 
      in oncology involve trade-offs between possible benefits and harms. MCDA can help 
      analyse trade-off preferences. A wide range of MCDA methods exist. Each method 
      has its strengths and weaknesses. Choosing the appropriate method varies 
      depending on the source and nature of information used to inform decision making. 
      The literature review identified eight studies. The analytical hierarchy process 
      (AHP) was the most often used method in the identified studies. CONCLUSION: 
      Overall, MCDA appears to be a promising tool that can be used to assist clinical 
      decision making in oncology. Nonetheless, field testing is desirable before MCDA 
      becomes an established decision-making tool in this field.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a useful tool in complex 
      decision-making situations, and has been used in medical fields to evaluate 
      treatment options and drug selection. This study aims to provide valuable 
      insights into MCDA in healthcare through examining the research focus of existing 
      studies, major fields, major applications, most productive authors and countries, 
      and most common journals in the domain. METHODS: A bibliometric analysis was 
      conducted on the publication related to MCDA in healthcare from the Web of 
      Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database on 14 July 2021. Three bibliometric 
      software (VOSviewer, R-bibliometrix, and CiteSpace) were used to conduct the 
      analysis including years, countries, institutes, authors, journals, co-citation 
      references, and keywords. RESULTS: A total of 410 publications were identified 
      with an average yearly growth rate of 32% (1999-2021), from 196 academic journals 
      with 23,637 co-citation references by 871 institutions from 70 countries/regions. 
      The United States was the most productive country (n = 80). Universiti Pendidikan 
      Sultan Idris (n = 16), Université de Montréal (n = 13), and Syreon Research 
      Institute (n = 12) were the top productive institutions. A A Zaidan, Mireille 
      Goetghebeur and Zoltan Kalo were the biggest nodes in every cluster of authors' 
      networks. The top journals in terms of the number of articles (n = 17) and 
      citations (n = 1,673) were Value in Health and Journal of Medical Systems, 
      respectively. The extant literature has focused on four aspects, including the 
      analytic hierarchy process (AHP), decision-making, health technology assessment, 
      and healthcare waste management. COVID-19 and fuzzy TOPSIS received careful 
      attention from MCDA applications recently. MCDA in big data, telemedicine, 
      TOPSIS, and fuzzy AHP is well-developed and an important theme, which may be the 
      trend in future research. CONCLUSION: This study uncovers a holistic picture of 
      the performance of MCDA-related literature published in healthcare. MCDA has a 
      broad application on different topics and would be helpful for practitioners, 
      researchers, and decision-makers working in healthcare to advance the wheel of 
      medical complex decision-making. It can be argued that the door is still open for 
      improving the role of MCDA in healthcare, whether in its methodology (e.g., fuzzy 
      TOPSIS) or application (e.g., telemedicine).

TI  - Multicriteria decision analysis in health care decision in oncology: a systematic 
      review.
PG  - 365-380
LID - 10.1080/14737167.2022.2019580 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) has been used to inform 
      health decisions in health technology assessments (HTA) processes. This is 
      particularly important to complex treatment decisions in oncology. AREAS COVERED: 
      Five databases (PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, Web of Science and CRD's NHS Economic 
      Evaluation Database) were searched for studies comparing health technologies in 
      oncology, involving the concept MCDA. The ISPOR MCDA Good Practices Guidelines 
      were used to assess the reporting quality. Study selection, appraisal, and data 
      extraction were performed by two reviewers. Fifteen studies were included. The 
      main decision problem was related to health technology assessment of cancer 
      treatments. Clinicians and public health experts were the most frequent 
      stakeholders. The most frequently included criteria comprised therapeutic 
      benefit, and socio-economic impact. Value measurement approach, direct rating 
      techniques, and additive model for aggregation were used in most studies. 
      Uncertainty analysis revealed the impact of posology and costs on the studies' 
      results. All studies showed some level of overlapping decision criteria. EXPERT 
      OPINION: There is considerable diversity of methods in MCDA for healthcare 
      decision-making in oncology. The evidence presented can serve as a resource when 
      considering which stakeholders, criteria, and techniques to include in future 
      MCDA studies in oncology.

AB  - PURPOSE: To quantitatively assess the benefit-risk ratio on the efficacy and 
      safety of all phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i) in men with erectile 
      dysfunction. METHODS: A systematic review with network meta-analysis, surface 
      under the cumulative ranking analysis and stochastic multicriteria acceptability 
      analyses were performed. Searches were conducted in Pubmed, Scopus, Web of 
      Science without limits for time-frame or language. Randomized controlled trials 
      evaluating the efficacy or safety of any PDE5i compared to a placebo or to other 
      PDE5i in males with erectile disfunction were included. RESULTS: Overall, 184 
      articles representing 179 randomized controlled trials (50,620 patients) were 
      included. All PDE5i were significantly more efficient than placebo. Sildenafil 
      25 mg was statistically superior to all interventions in enhancing IIEF (with a 
      98% probability of being the most effective treatment), followed by sildenafil 
      50 mg (80% of probability). Taladafil 10 mg and 20 mg also presented good 
      profiles (73% and 76%, respectively). Avanafil and lodenafil were less effective 
      interventions. Mirodenafil 150 mg was the treatment that caused more adverse 
      events, especially flushing and headaches. Sildenafil 100 mg was more related to 
      visual disorders, while vardenafil and udenafil were more prone to cause nasal 
      congestion. CONCLUSION: Sildenafil at low doses and tadalafil should be the first 
      therapeutic options. Avanafil, lodenafil and mirodenafil use are hardly justified 
      given the lack of expressive efficacy or high rates of adverse events.

TI  - The Application of Multicriteria Decision Analysis Methods in Health Care: A 
      Literature Review.
PG  - 262-274
LID - 10.1177/0272989X211019040 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The main objectives of this article are 2-fold. First, we explore the 
      application of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods in different areas 
      of health care, particularly the adoption of various MCDA methods across health 
      care decision making problems. Second, we report on the publication trends on the 
      application of MCDA methods in health care. METHOD: PubMed was searched for 
      literature from 1960 to 2019 in the English language. A wide range of keywords 
      was used to retrieve relevant studies. The literature search was performed in 
      September 2019. Articles were included only if they have reported an MCDA case in 
      health care. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The search yielded 8,318 abstracts, of which 
      158 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were considered for further analysis. 
      Hybrid methods are the most widely used methods in health care decision making 
      problems. When it comes to single methods, analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is 
      the most widely used method followed by TOPSIS (technique for order preference by 
      similarity to ideal solution), multiattribute utility theory, goal programming, 
      EVIDEM (evidence and value: impact on decision making), evidential reasoning, 
      discrete choice experiment, and so on. Interestingly, the usage of hybrid methods 
      has been high in recent years. AHP is most widely applied in screening and 
      diagnosing and followed by treatment, medical devices, resource allocation, and 
      so on. Furthermore, treatment, screening and diagnosing, medical devices, and 
      drug development and assessment got more attention in the MCDA context. It is 
      indicated that the application of MCDA methods to health care decision making 
      problem is determined by the nature and complexity of the health care problem. 
      However, guidelines and tools exist that assist in the selection of an MCDA 
      method.

TI  - Risk Attitude in Multicriteria Decision Analysis: A Compromise Approach.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18126536 [doi]
LID - 6536
AB  - In fields on which decisions need to be taken including health, as we are seeing 
      nowadays in the COVID-19 crisis, decision-makers face multiple criteria and 
      results with a random component. In stochastic multicriteria decision-making 
      models, the risk attitude of the decision maker is a relevant factor. 
      Traditionally, the shape of a utility function is the only element that 
      represents the decision maker's risk attitude. The eduction process of 
      multi-attribute utility functions implies some operational drawbacks, and it is 
      not always easy. In this paper, we propose a new element with which the decision 
      maker's risk attitude can be implemented: the selection of the stochastic 
      efficiency concept to be used during a decision analysis. We suggest representing 
      the risk attitude as a conflict between two poles: risk neutral attitude, 
      associated with best expectations, and risk aversion attitude, associated with a 
      lower uncertainty. The Extended Goal Programming formulation has inspired the 
      parameter that is introduced in a new risk attitude formulation. This parameter 
      reflects the trade-off between the two classical poles with respect to risk 
      attitude. Thus, we have produced a new stochastic efficiency concept that we call 
      Compromise Efficiency.

AB  - Vaccines have the potential to transform the health of all individuals and to 
      reduce the health inequality between rich and poor countries. However, to achieve 
      these goals, it is no longer sufficient to prioritize vaccine development using 
      cost-effectiveness as the sole indicator. During a symposium entitled "Mission 
      Grand Convergence-The Role of Vaccines," held in Siena, Italy, in July 2015, key 
      stakeholders agreed that the prioritization of vaccine development and deployment 
      must use multicriteria decision-making based on the following core concepts: (i) 
      mortality and severity of the disease, (ii) vaccine safety considerations, and 
      (iii) economic evaluation that captures the full benefits of vaccination.

TI  - Application of multicriteria decision analysis in health care: a systematic 
      review and bibliometric analysis.
PG  - 1894-905
LID - 10.1111/hex.12287 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) in health care has 
      become common. However, the literature lacks systematic review trend analysis on 
      the application of MCDA in health care. AIM: To systematically identify 
      applications of MCDA to the areas of health care, and to report on publication 
      trends. METHODS: English language studies published from January 1, 1980 until 
      October 1, 2013 were included. Electronic databases searches were supplemented by 
      searching conference proceedings and relevant journals. Studies considered for 
      inclusion were those using MCDA techniques within the areas of health care, and 
      involving the participation of decision makers. A bibliometric analysis was 
      undertaken to present the publication trends. RESULTS: A total of 66 citations 
      met the inclusion criteria. An increase in publication trend occurred in the 
      years 1990, 1997, 1999, 2005, 2008, and 2012. For the remaining years, the 
      publication trend was either steady or declining. The trend shows that the number 
      of publications reached its highest peak in 2012 (n = 9). Medical Decision Making 
      was the dominant with the highest number published papers (n = 7). The majority 
      of the studies were conducted in the US (n = 29). Medical Decision Making journal 
      published the highest number of articles (n = 7). Analytic Hierarchy Process (n = 
      33) was the most used MCDA technique. Cancer was the most researched disease 
      topic (n = 12). The most covered area of application was diagnosis and treatment 
      (n = 26). CONCLUSION: The review shows that MCDA has been applied to a broad 
      range of areas in the health care, with the use of a variety of methodological 
      approaches. Further research is needed to develop practice guidelines for the 
      appropriate application and reporting of MCDA methods.

TI  - The Use of Multicriteria Decision Analysis to Support Decision Making in 
      Healthcare: An Updated Systematic Literature Review.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is increasingly used for 
      decision making in healthcare. However, its application in different 
      decision-making contexts is still unclear. This study aimed to provide a 
      comprehensive review of MCDA studies performed to inform decisions in healthcare 
      and to summarize its application in different decision contexts. METHODS: We 
      updated a systematic review conducted in 2013 by searching Embase, MEDLINE, and 
      Google Scholar for MCDA studies in healthcare, published in English between 
      August 2013 and November 2020. We also expanded the search by reviewing grey 
      literature found via Trip Medical Database and Google, published between January 
      1990 and November 2020. A comprehensive template was developed to extract 
      information about the decision context, criteria, methods, stakeholders involved, 
      and sensitivity analyses conducted. RESULTS: From the 4295 identified studies, 
      473 studies were eligible for full-text review after assessing titles and 
      abstracts. Of those, 228 studies met the inclusion criteria and underwent data 
      extraction. The use of MCDA continues to grow in healthcare literature, with most 
      of the studies (49%) informing priority-setting decisions. Safety, cost, and 
      quality of care delivery are the most frequently used criteria, although there 
      are considerable differences across decision contexts. Almost half of the MCDA 
      studies used the linear additive model whereas scales and the analytical 
      hierarchy process were the most used techniques for scoring and weighting, 
      respectively. Not all studies report on each one of the MCDA steps, consider 
      axiomatic properties, or justify the methods used. CONCLUSIONS: A guide on how to 
      conduct and report MCDA that acknowledges the particularities of the different 
      decision contexts and methods needs to be developed.

TI  - A multicriteria decision analysis framework to measure equitable healthcare 
      access during COVID-19.
PG  - 101331
LID - 10.1016/j.jth.2022.101331 [doi]
AB  - The ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the need for 
      individuals to have easy access to healthcare facilities for treatment as well as 
      vaccinations. The surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations during 2020 also underscored 
      the fact that accessibility to nearby hospitals for testing, treatment and 
      vaccination sites is crucial for patients with fever or respiratory symptoms. 
      Although necessary, quantifying healthcare access is challenging as it depends on 
      a complex interaction between underlying socioeconomic and physical factors. In 
      this case study, we deployed a Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) approach 
      to uncover the barriers and their effect on healthcare access. Using a least cost 
      path (LCP) analysis we quantified the costs associated with healthcare access 
      from each census block group in the Los Angeles metropolitan area (LA Metro) to 
      the nearest hospital. Social vulnerability reported by the Centers for Disease 
      Control and Prevention (CDC), the daily number of COVID-19 cases from the Los 
      Angeles open data portal and built environment characteristics (slope of the 
      street, car ownership, population density distribution, walkability, traffic 
      collision density, and speed limit) were used to quantify overall accessibility 
      index for the entire study area. Our results showed that the census block groups 
      with a social vulnerability index above 0.75 (high vulnerability) had low 
      accessibility owing to the higher cost of access to nearby hospitals. These areas 
      were also coincident with the hotspots for COVID-19 cases and deaths which 
      highlighted the inequitable exposure of socially disadvantaged populations to 
      COVID-19 infections and how the pandemic impacts were exacerbated by the 
      synergistic effect of socioeconomic status and built environment characteristics 
      of the locations where the disadvantaged populations resided. The framework 
      proposed herein could be adapted to geo-target testing/vaccination sites and 
      improve accessibility to healthcare facilities in general and more specifically 
      among the socially vulnerable populations residing in urban areas to reduce their 
      overall health risks during future pandemic outbreaks.

TI  - Application of multicriteria decision analysis in environmental decision making.
PG  - 95-108
AB  - Decision making in environmental projects can be complex and seemingly 
      intractable, principally because of the inherent trade-offs between 
      sociopolitical, environmental, ecological, and economic factors. The selection of 
      appropriate remedial and abatement strategies for contaminated sites, land use 
      planning, and regulatory processes often involves multiple additional criteria 
      such as the distribution of costs and benefits, environmental impacts for 
      different populations, safety, ecological risk, or human values. Some of these 
      criteria cannot be easily condensed into a monetary value, partly because 
      environmental concerns often involve ethical and moral principles that may not be 
      related to any economic use or value. Furthermore, even if it were possible to 
      aggregate multiple criteria rankings into a common unit, this approach would not 
      always be desirable because the ability to track conflicting stakeholder 
      preferences may be lost in the process. Consequently, selecting from among many 
      different alternatives often involves making trade-offs that fail to satisfy 1 or 
      more stakeholder groups. Nevertheless, considerable research in the area of 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) has made available practical methods for 
      applying scientific decision theoretical approaches to complex multicriteria 
      problems. This paper presents a review of the available literature and provides 
      recommendations for applying MCDA techniques in environmental projects. A 
      generalized framework for decision analysis is proposed to highlight the 
      fundamental ingredients for more structured and tractable environmental decision 
      making.

TI  - A multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) tool to purchase implantable medical 
      devices in Egypt.
PG  - 289
LID - 10.1186/s12911-022-02025-y [doi]
LID - 289
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the availability of several similar medical devices performing 
      the same function, choosing one for reimbursement is not easy, especially if 
      purchased for a large number of patients. The objective of this project was to 
      create a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) tool, that captures and compares 
      all implantable medical devices' attributes, to provide an objective method for 
      choosing among the available options in Egypt. METHOD: We conducted a systematic 
      review and expert interviews, to identify the relevant criteria for inclusion in 
      the tool. Subsequently, a workshop was conducted, that involved experts in 
      procuring and tendering medical devices. Experts chose the criteria, ranked them, 
      assigned weights and scoring functions for each criterion, and then created the 
      draft tool. A pilot phase followed; then, another workshop was conducted to 
      fine-tune the tool. We readjusted the tool based on experts' experience with the 
      draft tool. RESULTS: The final tool included eight criteria, arranged according 
      to their weightage: technical characteristics (29.4%), country of origin (19.5%), 
      use in reference countries (14.9%), supply reliability (11.7%), previous use in 
      tenders (9.0%), instant replacement within product variety (6.9%), 
      pharmacovigilance (4.6%), and refund or replacement (4.0%). Each medical device 
      was assessed on these eight criteria to achieve a final score, that was compared 
      to the alternative devices' scores. Price is not included in the MCDA tool, but 
      it will be added in the financial evaluation phase. CONCLUSION: Decisionmakers 
      could use the MCDA tool, to make evidence-based and objective decisions for 
      purchasing implantable devices, in the Egyptian public sector. Post price 
      evaluation, the product with the best value will be chosen for reimbursement. 
      HIGHLIGHTS: We created an MCDA tool to help decision makers choose between 
      alternative implantable medical devices in Egypt. The MCDA tool includes eight 
      criteria, where price is evaluated as a separate step. "Technical 
      characteristics" and "country of origin" criteria carried the highest weights, 
      thus representing approximately 50% of the decision.

TI  - Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) for health technology assessment: the 
      Queensland Health experience.
PG  - 591-599
LID - 10.1071/AH18042 [doi]
AB  - Objectives In determining whether new health technologies should be funded, 
      health technology assessment (HTA) committees prefer explicit to implicit methods 
      of analysis in enhancing transparency and consistency of decision making. The aim 
      of this study was to develop and pilot a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) 
      framework for the Queensland Department of Health HTA program committee, which 
      weighted decision making criteria according to their perceived importance as 
      determined by group consensus. Methods The criteria used in the MCDA framework 
      were identified by reviewing the five unweighted criteria used in the existing 
      process, consultation with committee members and literature review. Criteria were 
      clearly defined and ordinal categories of lowest to highest preferred were 
      assigned against which technology submissions would be rated. Criteria weights 
      were determined through a discrete choice experiment (DCE) survey of committee 
      members using validated software. Mean weighted technology scores were then used 
      to guide deliberative discussions in determining final funding decisions. Results 
      The MCDA framework created one additional criterion to the previous five. The 
      criteria and their mean weights identified through the DCE survey were clinical 
      benefit and safety (27.2%), quality of evidence (19.2%), implementation capacity 
      (16.9%), innovation (15.4%), burden of disease and clinical need (13.3%) and 
      societal and ethical values (8.0%). Criterion weights varied considerably between 
      individual committee members, with one criterion having a difference of 36.9% 
      between the highest and lowest preference weights. Following deliberative 
      discussions, all but one of 10 submissions were awarded funding. The submission 
      not supported received the third lowest score through the MCDA model. Conclusions 
      This pilot application of an MCDA framework, as a complement to committee 
      deliberation, conferred greater transparency and objectivity on HTA assessment of 
      technologies. The framework converted an implicit, unweighted review process to 
      one that is more explicit, flexible in weighting importance and pragmatic. What 
      is known about the topic? HTA programs involve complex decision-making processes 
      requiring the consideration of multiple criteria. Explicit methods of analysis 
      that use weighted criteria according to their relative importance enhance 
      transparency and consistency of decision making by HTA committees, and are 
      preferred to implicit reviews using unweighted criteria. What does this paper 
      add? This article describes the development and piloting of an MCDA framework 
      that aims to improve transparency, objectivity and consistency of funding 
      decisions of the Queensland HTA committee. Criteria were identified through a 
      review of current processes, committee discussions and a literature review, and 
      the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) 
      quality of evidence system. Criteria were weighted using a discrete choice 
      experiment involving committee members. Using weighted criteria, mean technology 
      scores were calculated and incorporated into deliberative discussions to 
      determine funding decisions. What are the implications for practitioners? The 
      MCDA framework described here converted a more implicit, unweighted process to 
      one that was more pragmatic, explicit and flexible in scoring HTA submissions. 
      This framework may be useful to other HTA programs and could be expanded to 
      resource allocation decision making in many other healthcare settings.

AB  - Cloud computing (CC) has recently been receiving tremendous attention from the IT 
      industry and academic researchers. CC leverages its unique services to cloud 
      customers in a pay-as-you-go, anytime, anywhere manner. Cloud services provide 
      dynamically scalable services through the Internet on demand. Therefore, service 
      provisioning plays a key role in CC. The cloud customer must be able to select 
      appropriate services according to his or her needs. Several approaches have been 
      proposed to solve the service selection problem, including multicriteria decision 
      analysis (MCDA). MCDA enables the user to choose from among a number of available 
      choices. In this paper, we analyze the application of MCDA to service selection 
      in CC. We identify and synthesize several MCDA techniques and provide a 
      comprehensive analysis of this technology for general readers. In addition, we 
      present a taxonomy derived from a survey of the current literature. Finally, we 
      highlight several state-of-the-art practical aspects of MCDA implementation in 
      cloud computing service selection. The contributions of this study are four-fold: 
      (a) focusing on the state-of-the-art MCDA techniques, (b) highlighting the 
      comparative analysis and suitability of several MCDA methods, (c) presenting a 
      taxonomy through extensive literature review, and (d) analyzing and summarizing 
      the cloud computing service selections in different scenarios.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to understand the importance of criteria describing 
      methods (eg, duration, costs, validity, and outcomes) according to decision 
      makers for each decision point in the medical product lifecycle (MPLC) and to 
      determine the suitability of a discrete choice experiment, swing weighting, 
      probabilistic threshold technique, and best-worst scale cases 1 and 2 at each 
      decision point in the MPLC. METHODS: Applying multicriteria decision analysis, an 
      online survey was sent to MPLC decision makers (ie, industry, regulatory, and 
      health technology assessment representatives). They ranked and weighted 19 
      methods criteria from an existing performance matrix about their respective 
      decisions across the MPLC. All criteria were given a relative weight based on the 
      ranking and rating in the survey after which an overall suitability score was 
      calculated for each preference elicitation method per decision point. Sensitivity 
      analyses were conducted to reflect uncertainty in the performance matrix. 
      RESULTS: Fifty-nine industry, 29 regulatory, and 5 health technology assessment 
      representatives completed the surveys. Overall, "estimating trade-offs between 
      treatment characteristics" and "estimating weights for treatment characteristics" 
      were highly important criteria throughout all MPLC decision points, whereas other 
      criteria were most important only for specific MPLC stages. Swing weighting and 
      probabilistic threshold technique received significantly higher suitability 
      scores across decision points than other methods. Sensitivity analyses showed 
      substantial impact of uncertainty in the performance matrix. CONCLUSION: Although 
      discrete choice experiment is the most applied preference elicitation method, 
      other methods should also be considered to address the needs of decision makers. 
      Development of evidence-based guidance documents for designing, conducting, and 
      analyzing such methods could enhance their use.

TI  - Multicriteria Decision Analysis for Updating of Quality Indicators for 
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease Comprehensive Care Units in Spain.
PG  - 1663-1675
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjac068 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Management of inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] is complex 
      and IBD Comprehensive Care Units [ICCUs] facilitate the delivery of quality care 
      to IBD patients. The objective of this study was to update the existing set of 
      quality indicators [QIs] for ICCUs, based on a nationwide quality certification 
      programme carried out in Spain, from a multi-stakeholder perspective and using 
      multicriteria decision analysis [MCDA] methodology. METHODS: An MCDA comprising 
      three different phases was conducted. In phase 1, a systematic literature review 
      was performed, and after validation by a scientific committee comprising 11 
      experts, a preliminary set of QIs was developed. In phase 2, a larger group of 49 
      experts determined the relevance and relative importance of each QI by 
      prioritising and weighing the preliminary set. Finally in phase 3, the scientific 
      committee reviewed the results and made a final selection via a deliberative 
      process. RESULTS: The final set comprised 67 QIs, classified as Structure [23 
      QIs], Process [35 QIs] and Outcome [9 QIs], which were ranked according to their 
      relative importance. Multidisciplinary management was the most important 
      requirement in ICCUs, followed by continuity of care, standardisation of clinical 
      care and, especially, the incorporation of patients' reported outcomes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This updated set of QIs comprises a weighted and prioritised set of 
      items that represent the essential minimum of criteria for ensuring appropriate 
      quality of care in the management of IBD patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the extent to which stated preferences for treatment 
      criteria elicited using multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods are 
      consistent with the trade-offs (implicitly) applied in cost-effectiveness 
      analysis (CEA), and the impact of any differences on the prioritization of 
      treatments. METHODS: We used existing MCDA and CEA models developed to evaluate 
      interventions for knee osteoarthritis in the New Zealand population. We 
      established equivalent input parameters for each model, for the criteria 
      "treatment effectiveness," "cost," "risk of serious harms," and "risk of 
      mild-to-moderate harms" across a comprehensive range of (hypothetical) 
      interventions to produce a complete ranking of interventions from each model. We 
      evaluated the consistency of these rankings between the 2 models and investigated 
      any systematic differences between the (implied) weight placed on each criterion 
      in determining rankings. RESULTS: There was an overall moderate-to-strong 
      correlation in intervention rankings between the MCDA and CEA models (Spearman 
      correlation coefficient = 0.51). Nevertheless, there were systematic differences 
      in the evaluation of trade-offs between intervention attributes and the resulting 
      weights placed on each criterion. The CEA model placed lower weights on risks of 
      harm and much greater weight on cost (at all accepted levels of 
      willingness-to-pay per quality-adjusted life-year than did respondents to the 
      MCDA survey. CONCLUSIONS: MCDA and CEA approaches to inform intervention 
      prioritization may give systematically different results, even when considering 
      the same criteria and input data. These differences should be considered when 
      designing and interpreting such studies to inform treatment prioritization 
      decisions.

TI  - Multicriteria Decision Analysis Characterization of Chemical Hazard Assessment 
      Data Sources.

AB  - Chemical hazard assessment (CHA), which aims to investigate the inherent hazard 
      potential of chemicals, has been developed with the purpose of promoting safer 
      consumer products. Despite the increasing use of CHA in recent years, finding 
      adequate and reliable toxicity data required for CHA is still challenging due to 
      issues regarding data completeness and data quality. Also, collecting data from 
      primary toxicity reports or literature can be time consuming, which promotes the 
      use of secondary data sources instead. In this study, we evaluate and 
      characterize numerous secondary data sources on the basis of 5 performance 
      attributes: reliability, adequacy, transparency, volume, and ease of use. We use 
      GreenScreen for Safer Chemicals v1.4 as the CHA framework, which defines the 
      endpoints of interest used in this analysis. We focused upon 34 data sources that 
      reflect 3 types of secondary data: chemical-oriented data sources, 
      hazard-trait-oriented data sources, and predictive data sources. To integrate and 
      analyze the evaluation results, we applied 2 multicriteria decision analysis 
      (MCDA) methodologies: multiattribute utility theory (MAUT) and stochastic 
      multiobjective acceptability analysis (SMAA). Overall, the findings in this 
      research program allow us to explore the relative importance of performance 
      criteria and the data source quality for effectively conducting CHA. Integr

AB  - BACKGROUND: The health area is one of the most affected systems on the 
      perspective of decision-making with multiobjectives, thus becoming prone to 
      errors in the final solution, however, multicriteria decision analysis (MDCA) 
      appears as an aid tool for this process decision-making. Therefore,the present 
      study aims to analyze and synthesize articles found in the literature, involing 
      MCDA in health care, evaluating general issues and methodological aspects, 
      structuring them in a single work. METHODS: Surveys in the bibliographic 
      databases SCOPUS and PUBMED indicated 1852 documents on the subject, however 
      after a careful verificatios, 66 studies were selected to be analyzed completely. 
      The data extracted from the included articles were organized into a spreadsheet 
      for the preparation of analysis, and the technique used was descriptive 
      statistics. RESULTS: It was possible to identify a growth trend in the 
      application of the MCDA in the health area, but no dominance was identified in 
      relation to the authors of the publication and the periodicals where they are 
      published, but some countries stood out in terms of the number of published 
      researches, such as: Canada and Turkey. In defining the decision problem, and in 
      defining criteria, the "literature" presented the greatest demand for those who 
      wish to structure their decision problem. Finally, it was verified by the 
      analysis of the problem, that the MCDA to solve the problems of ranking has 
      comprehensive application and that there is a greater incidence in the use of the 
      AHP and Logic methods Fuzzy. CONCLUSION: With this, it is possible to observe, 
      through the data of this review, that more than the multicriteria methods, the 
      multicriteria decision model has been highlighted, also in the health area. In 
      addition, the study can guide new applications and techniques using MCDA in the 
      health care.

TI  - A multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) applied to three long-term prophylactic 
      treatments for hereditary angioedema in Spain.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disease that impairs 
      quality of life and could be life-threatening. The aim of this study was to apply 
      a multicriteria decision analysis to assess the value of three long-term 
      prophylactic (LTP) therapies for HAE in Spain. METHODS: A multidisciplinary 
      committee of 10 experts assessed the value of lanadelumab (subcutaneous use), 
      C1-inhibitor (C1-INH; intravenous), and danazol (orally), using placebo as 
      comparator. We followed the EVIDEM methodology that considers a set of 13 
      quantitative criteria. The overall estimated value of each intervention was 
      obtained combining the weighting of each criterion with the scoring of each 
      intervention in each criterion. We used two alternative weighting methods: 
      hierarchical point allocation (HPA) and direct rating scale (DRS). A reevaluation 
      of weightings and scores was performed. RESULTS: Lanadelumab obtained higher mean 
      scores than C1-INH and danazol in all criteria, except for the cost of the 
      intervention and clinical practice guidelines. Under the HPA method, the 
      estimated values were 0.51 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.44-0.58) for 
      lanadelumab, 0.47 (95%CI: 0.41-0.53) for C1-INH, and 0.31 (95%CI: 0.24-0.39) for 
      danazol. Similar results were obtained with the DRS method: 0.51 (95%CI: 
      0.42-0.60), 0.47 (95%CI: 0.40-0.54), and 0.27 (95%CI: 0.18-0.37), respectively. 
      The comparative cost of the intervention was the only criterion that contributed 
      negatively to the values of lanadelumab and C1-INH. For danazol, four criteria 
      contributed negatively, mainly comparative safety. CONCLUSION: Lanadelumab was 
      assessed as a high-value intervention, better than C1-INH and substantially 
      better than danazol for LTP treatment of HAE.

AB  - Biomass obtained from microalgae research studies gained momentum in recent years 
      because of their extensive application potential in multiple industries such as 
      high-value nutraceuticals, bioproducts, cosmetics, animal feed industries, and 
      biofuels while being a sustainable and environmentally friendly option. Although 
      they have high biomass yields and rapid growth rates there are some limitations 
      and challenges that remain for large-scale commercialized cultivation and 
      harvesting methods of microalgae. Since there are multiple pathways related to 
      efficient cultivation and harvesting methods to be viable, this study adopted, 
      TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution), a 
      multicriteria decision-making tool, to find the most acceptable alternative by 
      using excel spreadsheets to evaluate the information that is derived from 
      literature and pilot-scale studies. As a result, tubular (helical) and plate 
      (flat panel) photobioreactors (PBRs) for cultivation and chemical harvesting 
      (with chitosan) and bio-flocculation for harvesting were deemed suitable, while 
      plastic bag PBR and suspended air flotation were deemed unsuitable.

TI  - Multicriteria Decision Analysis Applied to the Clinical Use of Pharmacotherapy 
      for Overactive Bladder Symptom Complex.
PG  - 522-530

AB  - CONTEXT: The nonspecific storage symptom complex overactive bladder (OAB) is an 
      important clinical condition in functional urology. Until recently, 
      pharmacological therapy comprised antimuscarinic drugs, but more recently beta 3 
      agonists have added to the available agents. Traditional reporting of efficacy 
      and safety of these agents relies upon regulatory placebo-controlled studies. 
      There remains no head-to-head comparison of existing agents in the contemporary 
      literature. Contemporary conclusions on comparative efficacy and safety drawn 
      from the use of these agents are based on systematic reviews of the literature 
      and associated meta-analyses. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we used the analytical 
      model of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) to compare contemporary 
      pharmacotherapy for OAB. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Efficacy and safety data from 
      published, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of antimuscarinic antagonists, 
      the beta 3 agonist, and the combination of an antimuscarinic and beta 3 agonist 
      were used to populate the MCDA model. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Experts assessed 
      weights of the relative importance of favourable and unfavourable effects, which 
      provided a common measure of benefits and safety that were combined in the MCDA 
      model to give an overall ranking of the OAB drugs. RESULTS: When benefits are 
      judged as more important than safety, fesoterodine 4 or 8mg used in a flexible 
      dosing pattern provides the most favourable therapeutic option, over a wide 
      sensitivity analysis relating to benefits and harms. CONCLUSIONS: In our analysis 
      using an MCDA model, in both the flexible dosing pattern of fesoterodine and the 
      solifenacin combination with mirabegron, the benefit-safety balance is better in 
      terms of benefits and/or safety than any of the other available OAB drugs. 
      Caution in interpretation of the data has to be expressed as the fesoterodine 
      data are based on a flexible dosing regimen, which adds an additional dimension 
      of personalising therapy. PATIENT SUMMARY: Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common 
      condition with a significant impact on the quality of life. Possible symptoms 
      include the following: (1) urgency-a compelling desire to urinate, which is 
      difficult to defer; (2) urgency urinary incontinence-urgency leading to 
      incontinence episodes; (3) frequency-increased frequency of wanting to pass 
      urine; and (4) nocturia-increase in instances of getting up at night to urinate. 
      To date, the mainstay of therapy for OAB has been antimuscarinic drugs and, more 
      recently, the beta 3 agonist mirabegron. Ten international experts in urology, 
      obstetrics, gynaecology, healthy ageing, and data analysis compared the 
      benefit-risk balance of 14 OAB drugs licensed in Europe. The experts considered 
      the importance of a favourable effect on the above four symptoms and also 
      potential for side effects, but only three of these side effects, constipation, 
      dry mouth, and dizziness, showed clinically relevant differences among the six 
      drugs they considered. The observations recorded here suggest interesting 
      differences between drugs across a wide range of possible trade-offs between 
      benefit and safety. The different recruitment criteria used for each study may 
      influence the results seen, so they need to be treated with caution. Comparison 
      of flexibly dosed fesoterodine studies with fixed-dose fesoterodine studies 
      introduces an additional potential bias; definitive conclusions can be drawn only 
      if enough comparable placebo-controlled flexible dosing studies with other drugs 
      were available.

TI  - A Multicriteria Decision Analysis Comparing Pharmacotherapy for Chronic 
      Neuropathic Pain, Including Cannabinoids and Cannabis-Based Medical Products.
PG  - 482-500
LID - 10.1089/can.2020.0129 [doi]
AB  - Background: Pharmacological management of chronic neuropathic pain (CNP) still 
      represents a major clinical challenge. Collective harnessing of both the 
      scientific evidence base and clinical experience (of clinicians and patients) can 
      play a key role in informing treatment pathways and contribute to the debate on 
      specific treatments (e.g., cannabinoids). A group of expert clinicians (pain 
      specialists and psychiatrists), scientists, and patient representatives convened 
      to assess the relative benefit-safety balance of 12 pharmacological treatments, 
      including orally administered cannabinoids/cannabis-based medicinal products, for 
      the treatment of CNP in adults. Methods: A decision conference provided the 
      process of creating a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) model, in which the 
      group collectively scored the drugs on 17 effect criteria relevant to benefits 
      and safety and then weighted the criteria for their clinical relevance. Findings: 
      Cannabis-based medicinal products consisting of tetrahydrocannabinol/cannabidiol 
      (THC/CBD), in a 1:1 ratio, achieved the highest overall score, 79 (out of 100), 
      followed by CBD dominant at 75, then THC dominant at 72. Duloxetine and the 
      gabapentinoids scored in the 60s, amitriptyline, tramadol, and ibuprofen in the 
      50s, methadone and oxycodone in the 40s, and morphine and fentanyl in the 30s. 
      Sensitivity analyses showed that even if the pain reduction and quality-of-life 
      scores for THC/CBD and THC are halved, their benefit-safety balances remain 
      better than those of the noncannabinoid drugs. Interpretation: The benefit-safety 
      profiles for cannabinoids were higher than for other commonly used medications 
      for CNP largely because they contribute more to quality of life and have a more 
      favorable side effect profile. The results also reflect the shortcomings of 
      alternative pharmacological treatments with respect to safety and mitigation of 
      neuropathic pain symptoms. Further high-quality clinical trials and systematic 
      comprehensive capture of clinical experience with cannabinoids is warranted. 
      These results demonstrate once again the complexity and multimodal mechanisms 
      underlying the clinical experience and impact of chronic pain.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To prioritise vaccines for introduction in Bangladesh. METHODS: 
      Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) process was used to prioritise potential 
      vaccines for introduction in Bangladesh. A set of criteria were identified, 
      weighted and assigned scores by relevant stakeholders (n=14) during workshop A. 
      The performance matrix of the data of vaccines against the criteria set was 
      constructed and validated with the experts (n=6) in workshop B. The vaccines were 
      ranked and appraised by another group of stakeholders (n=10) in workshop C, and 
      the final workshop D involved the dissemination of the findings to 
      decision-makers (n=28). RESULTS: Five criteria including incidence rate, case 
      fatality rate, vaccine efficacy, size of the population at risk and type of 
      population at risk were used quantitatively to evaluate and to score the 
      vaccines. Two other criteria, cost-effectiveness and outbreak potentiality, were 
      considered qualitatively. On deliberation, the Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine 
      was ranked top to be recommended for introduction in Bangladesh. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Based on the MCDA results, JE vaccine is planned to be recommended to the 
      decision-makers for introduction into the national vaccine benefit package. The 
      policymakers support the use of systematic evidence-based decision-making 
      processes such as MCDA for vaccine introduction in Bangladesh, and to prioritise 
      health interventions in the country.

TI  - Moving Beyond Quality-Adjusted Life-Years in Elderly Care: How Can Multicriteria 
      Decision Analysis Complement Cost-Effectiveness Analysis in Local-Level Decision 
      Making.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate how multicriteria decision analysis 
      (MCDA) could complement cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) to support investment 
      decisions in elderly care at local level. METHODS: We used an integrated elderly 
      care program in The Netherlands as a case study to demonstrate the application of 
      both methods. In a 12-month quasi-experimental study (n = 384), data on the 
      following outcome measures were collected: quality-adjusted life-years (CEA) and 
      physical functioning, psychological well-being, social relationships and 
      participation, enjoyment of life, resilience, person centeredness, continuity of 
      care, and costs (MCDA). We performed regression analysis on inversed probability 
      weighted data and controlled for potential confounders to obtain a double robust 
      estimate of the outcomes. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses determined 
      uncertainty for both methods. RESULTS: The integrated elderly care program was 
      not likely (ie, 36%) to be cost-effective according to the CEA (incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratios: €88 249 from a societal perspective) using the 
      conventional Dutch willingness-to-pay threshold (ie, €50 000). The MCDA 
      demonstrated that informal caregivers and professionals slightly preferred the 
      intervention over usual care, driven by enjoyment of life and person 
      centeredness. Patients did not prefer either the intervention or usual care, 
      whereas payers and policy makers slightly preferred usual care, mainly due to 
      higher costs of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: MCDA could provide local-level 
      decision makers with a broader measurement of effectiveness by including outcomes 
      beyond health and longevity and the preferences of multiple stakeholders. This 
      additional information could foster the acceptability and implementability of 
      cost-effective innovations in elderly care.

TI  - International experiences in multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) for 
      evaluating orphan drugs: a scoping review.
PG  - 409-420
LID - 10.1080/14737167.2019.1633918 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Orphan diseases are low-prevalence conditions with chronically 
      debilitating or life-threatening consequences. Their treatments are generally 
      called orphan drugs (OD). Health-technology assessment processes have 
      traditionally considered cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), when making 
      reimbursement and pricing decisions for health-care plans. Valuing OD with 
      standard CEA raises important issues due to uncertain evidence, inability to meet 
      cost-effectiveness thresholds for reimbursement and high budget impact, among 
      others. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) allows to overcome these issues 
      and improve the technical and ethical quality of decisions regarding 
      prioritization, coverage, and reimbursement of OD. Areas covered: A scoping 
      review was conducted in order to characterize MCDA frameworks for assessing OD 
      and implementation experiences. We reviewed electronic databases (Medline, 
      Embase, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, CINAHL, EconLit, Web of Science, LILACS, Google 
      Scholar) key journals (Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases and Value in Health) and 
      organization repositories. Expert opinion: The theoretical framework for MCDA 
      considers areas related to characteristics of orphan diseases and their 
      technologies' clinical and economic impact. Participation processes are critical 
      in incorporating societal values in weighting different dimensions and 
      constructing decision rules. Local implementation pilots considering different 
      stakeholders are necessary in order to pinpoint specific barriers and 
      opportunities.

AB  - This study presents the application of one of the tools from the multicriteria 
      decision analysis set (MCDA), the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to 
      Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Selected green analytical chemistry metrics were used to 
      rank analytical procedures for the phthalate determination in disposable baby 
      diapers. Nine analytical procedures were assessed in order to find one that has 
      the lowest environmental impact and the best analytical figures of merit. Nine 
      different criteria, where weighting was based on the experts' evaluation, were 
      used in the procedures' assessment. With the use of TOPSIS, an easy and 
      straightforward technique, selection of the most appropriate procedure was made.

TI  - Application of Multicriteria Decision Analysis to Determine the Value of 
      Prophylaxis Relative to On-Demand Treatment in Hemophilia A and Emicizumab versus 
      Replacement Therapy in the Greek Healthcare Setting.
PG  - 75-85
LID - 10.1007/s40261-021-01108-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hemophilia A (HA) is a rare disease that is 
      characterized by congenital underproduction or dysfunction of the endogenous 
      coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). The aim of the present study was to determine 
      the value of prophylaxis versus on-demand treatment strategies for moderate to 
      severe HA (MtSHA) patients and the value of emicizumab in the prophylaxis of 
      MtSHA in Greece, compared with short half-life (SHL) FVIII and extended half-life 
      (EHL) FVIII through multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA). METHODS: A literature 
      review was performed to identify a set of criteria relevant to the therapeutic 
      approaches and therapies under investigation. A performance matrix was populated 
      by two literature reviews and meta-analyses. The criteria selected were 
      hierarchically classified by allocating weights on a 0-100 scale. The 
      performances of therapies were scored at the 100-point scale. The value judgments 
      utilized for weighing and scoring were sourced via a survey among independent 
      multidisciplinary system stakeholders. A linear additive value function was used 
      for the calculation of total value estimates. RESULTS: The participants ranked 
      'annual number of bleedings per patient' and 'percentage of target joint bleeds' 
      as the most important criteria, while the least important criterion was the 
      'annual treatment cost' for both assessments. Based on the weights elicited and 
      the performance in each criterion, the overall value score was higher for 
      prophylaxis treatment (58.27) compared with on-demand treatment (40.13). In the 
      other comparison, the most valued treatment was emicizumab (77.05) followed by 
      EHL FVIII (71.52) and SHL FVIII (19.88). According to the participants, the most 
      important factors for managing MtSHA patients are those related to successful 
      management of bleeding events given their contribution to improved quality of 
      life (QoL) and reduced morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: This MCDA has shown that the 
      prophylaxis strategy was perceived as a more valuable option for managing MtSHA 
      patients when compared with the on-demand strategy. Moreover, emicizumab adds 
      higher value and improves patient QoL compared with replacement therapy for MtSHA 
      in Greece. Emicizumab addresses important unmet needs due to its improved 
      efficacy and mode of administration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of the FeminFER project was to assess the value of 
      ferric carboxymaltose following a multicriteria decision analysis in obstetrics 
      and gynaecology in Spain. METHODS: Ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) and ferrous 
      sulphate were evaluated using the EVIDEM framework. Ten stakeholders participated 
      to collect different perspectives. The framework was adapted considering evidence 
      retrieved with a PICO-S search strategy and grey literature. Criteria/subcriteria 
      were weighted by level of relevance and an evidence-based decision-making 
      exercise was developed in each criterion; weights and scores were combined to 
      obtain the value of intervention relative to each criterion/subcriterion, that 
      were further combined into the Modulated Relative Benefit-Risk Balance (MRBRB). 
      RESULTS: The most important criterion favouring FCM was Compared 
      Efficacy/Effectiveness (0.183 ± 0.07), followed by Patient Preferences 
      (0.059 ± 0.10). Only Direct medical costs criterion favoured FS (-0.003 ± 0.03). 
      MRBRB favoured FCM; 0.45 ± 0.19; in a scale from -1 to + 1. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      conclusion, considering the several criteria involved in the decision-making 
      process, participants agreed with the use of FCM according to its MRBRB.

TI  - GIS-based multicriteria decision analysis for settlement areas: a case study in 
      Canik.
PG  - 35746-35759
LID - 10.1007/s11356-021-17970-w [doi]
AB  - In addition to global population growth due to migration from rural areas to 
      urban areas, population density is constantly increasing in certain regions, 
      thereby necessitating the introduction of new settlements in these regions. 
      However, in the selection of settlement areas, no sufficient preliminary 
      examinations have been conducted; consequently, various natural disasters may 
      cause significant life and property losses. Herein, the most suitable settlement 
      areas were determined using GIS (geographic information systems) in Canik 
      District, where the population is continuously increasing. Therefore, this study 
      aimed to incorporate a new perspective into studies on this subject. Within the 
      scope of the study, landslide and flood risks, which are among the most important 
      natural disasters in the region, were primarily evaluated, and high-risk areas 
      were determined. Elevation, slope, aspect, curvature, lithology, topographic 
      humidity index (TWI), and proximity to river parameters were used to produce 
      flood susceptibility maps. A digital elevation model (DEM) of the study area was 
      produced using contours on the 1/25,000 scaled topographic map. The elevation, 
      slope, aspect, curvature, and TWI parameters were produced from the DEM using the 
      relevant analysis routines of ArcGIS software. The raster map of each parameter 
      was divided into 5 subclasses using the natural breaks classification method. In 
      the reclassified raster maps, the most flood-sensitive or flood-prone subclasses 
      were assigned a value of 5, and the least sensitive subclasses were assigned a 
      value of 1. Then, the reclassified maps of the 7 parameters were collected using 
      the "map algebra" function of ArcGIS 10.5 software, and the flood susceptibility 
      index (FSI) map of the study area was obtained. The flood susceptibility map of 
      the study area was obtained by dividing the FSI into 5 subclasses (very low, low, 
      moderate, high, and very high) according to the natural breaks classification 
      method. Thereafter, suitable and unsuitable areas in terms of biocomfort, which 
      affects people's health, peace, comfort, and psychology and is significant in 
      terms of energy efficiency, were determined. At the last stage of the study, the 
      most suitable settlement areas that were suitable in terms of both biocomfort and 
      low levels of landslide and flood risks were determined. The calculated 
      proportion of such areas to the total study area was only 2.1%. Therefore, 
      because these areas were insufficient for the establishment of new settlements, 
      areas that had low landslide and flood risks but were unsuitable for biocomfort 
      were secondarily determined; the ratio of these areas was calculated as 56.8%. 
      The remaining areas were inconvenient for the establishment of settlements due to 
      the risk of landslides and floods; the ratio of these areas was calculated as 
      41.1%. This study is exemplary in that the priority for the selection of 
      settlement areas was specified, and this method can be applied for selecting new 
      settlements for each region considering different criteria. Due to the risk of 
      landslides or flooding in the study area, the areas unsuitable for establishing a 
      settlement covered approximately 41.1% of the total study area. The areas that 
      had low flood and landslide risks but were suitable for biocomfort constituted 
      only 2.1% of the study area. In approximately 56.8% of the study area, the risk 
      of landslides or floods was low, and these areas were unsuitable in terms of 
      biocomfort. Therefore, these areas were secondarily preferred as settlement 
      areas. The most suitable areas for settlements constituted only 0.19% of the 
      total study area, and these areas will not be able to meet the increasing demand 
      for settlement area. Therefore, it is recommended to select areas that do not 
      have the risk of landslides and floods but are unsuitable for biocomfort. This 
      study reveals that grading should be performed in the selection of settlement 
      areas. When choosing a settlement area in any region, possible natural disasters 
      in the region should be identified first, and these disasters should be ordered 
      in terms of their threat potential. Moreover, biocomfort areas suitable for 
      settlements should be considered. In the next stages of settlement area 
      selection, the criteria that affect the peace and comfort of people, such as 
      distance to pollution sources, distance to noise sources, and proximity to 
      natural areas, should also be evaluated. Thus, a priority order should be created 
      for the selection of settlement areas using various other criteria.

TI  - Additive Multicriteria Decision Analysis Models: Misleading Aids for 
      Life-Critical Shared Decision Making.
PG  - 437-449

AB  - Background. There is growing interest in multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) 
      for shared decision making (SDM). A distinguishing feature is that a preferred 
      treatment should extend years of life and/or improve health-related quality of 
      life (HRQL). Additive MCDA models are inadequate for the task. A plethora of MCDA 
      models exist, each claiming that it can correctly solve real-world problems. 
      However, most were developed in nonhealth fields and rely on additive models. 
      This makes the problem of choosing an MCDA model as an aid for SDM a challenging 
      and urgent one. Methods. A published 2017 MCDA of a hypothetical prostate cancer 
      patient is used as a case in point of how not to do and how to do MCDA for SDM. 
      We critically review it and analyze it using several additive linear MCDA models 
      with years of life and HRQL as attributes and the linear quality-adjusted 
      life-year (QALY) model. The following simple reasonableness test is presented for 
      applicability of a method as an aid for SDM: Can a treatment that causes 
      premature death trump a treatment that causes acceptable adverse effects? 
      Results. Additive MCDA models and the linear QALY recommend significantly 
      different alternatives. Additive MCDA models fail the proposed reasonableness 
      test; the linear QALY model passes. Conclusions. MCDA possesses a strong craft 
      element in addition to its technical aspects. MCDA practitioners and clinicians 
      need to understand model limitations to choose models appropriate to the context. 
      Additive MCDA models are inadequate for life-critical SDM. We advocate QALY 
      models with additional research for increased realism as a tool for SDM.

TI  - A multi-stakeholder multicriteria decision analysis for the reimbursement of 
      orphan drugs (FinMHU-MCDA study).
PG  - 186

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient access to orphan medicinal products (OMPs) is limited and 
      varies between countries, reimbursement decisions on OMPs are complex, and there 
      is a need for more transparent processes to know which criteria should be 
      considered to inform these decisions. This study aimed to determine the most 
      relevant criteria for the reimbursement of OMPs in Spain, from a 
      multi-stakeholder perspective, and using multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA). 
      METHODS: An MCDA was developed in 3 phases and included 28 stakeholders closely 
      related to the field of rare diseases (6 physicians, 5 hospital pharmacists, 7 
      health economists, 4 patient representatives and 6 members from national and 
      regional health authorities). Initially [phase A], a bibliographic review was 
      conducted to identify the potential reimbursement criteria. Then, a reduced 
      advisory board (8 members) proposed, selected, and defined the final list of 
      criteria that could be relevant for reimbursement. A discrete choice experiment 
      (DCE) [phase B] was developed to determine the relevance and relative importance 
      weight of such criteria according to the stakeholders' preferences by choosing 
      between pairs of hypothetical financing scenarios. A multinomial logit model was 
      fitted to analyze the DCE responses. Finally [phase C], the advisory board review 
      the results using a deliberative process. RESULTS: Thirteen criteria were 
      selected, related to 4 dimensions: patient population, disease, treatment, and 
      economic evaluation. Nine criteria were deemed relevant for decision-making and 
      associated with a higher relative importance: Health-related quality of life 
      (HRQL) (23.53%), treatment efficacy (14.64%), availability of treatment 
      alternatives (13.51%), disease severity (12.62%), avoided costs (11.21%), age of 
      target population (7.75%), safety (seriousness of adverse events) (4.72%), 
      quality of evidence (3.82%) and size of target population (3.12%). The remaining 
      criteria had a < 3% relative importance: economic burden of disease (2.50%), cost 
      of treatment (1.73%), cost-effectiveness (0.83%) and safety (frequency of adverse 
      events) (0.03%). CONCLUSION: The reimbursement of OMPs in Spain should be 
      determined by its effect on patient's HRQL, the extent of its therapeutic benefit 
      from efficacy and the availability of other therapeutic options. Furthermore, the 
      severity of the rare disease should also influence the decision along with the 
      potential of the treatment to avoid associated costs.

TI  - Multicriteria Decision Analysis Applied to Sponge City Construction in China: A 
      Case Study.
PG  - 703-713
LID - 10.1002/ieam.4163 [doi]
AB  - To address stormwater management, China initiated the construction of sponge 
      cities (SPCs) in 2014. Sponge city construction in China has previously been 
      evaluated using subjective expert methods. Based on China's SPC evaluation 
      regulations, the evaluation criteria system was divided into 6 categories and 22 
      indicators. This study presents a multicriteria approach to evaluating SPC 
      construction through multicriteria attributes value theory (MAVT). Coupled with 
      the entropy method, this approach can reduce errors caused by individual methods. 
      This work improved the evaluation method from a subjective to an objective 
      method. Additionally, the sensitivity of an alternative to these criteria was 
      conducted. The analysis reveals the inner relationship between the SPC 
      alternative and the criteria. The city of Hebi, an actual SPC project, was 
      selected as a case study. The findings indicate that the proposed approach is 
      efficient and simple. It can help decision makers better understand SPC 
      performance, and it is a pilot SPC evaluation method using relatively objective 
      means. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2019;15:703-713. © 2019 SETAC.

TI  - Can Streamlined Multicriteria Decision Analysis Be Used to Implement Shared 
      Decision Making for Colorectal Cancer Screening?
PG  - 746-55
LID - 10.1177/0272989X13513338 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current US colorectal cancer screening guidelines that call for 
      shared decision making regarding the choice among several recommended screening 
      options are difficult to implement. Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is an 
      established method well suited for supporting shared decision making. Our study 
      goal was to determine whether a streamlined form of MCDA using rank-order-based 
      judgments can accurately assess patients' colorectal cancer screening priorities. 
      METHODS: We converted priorities for 4 decision criteria and 3 subcriteria 
      regarding colorectal cancer screening obtained from 484 average-risk patients 
      using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) in a prior study into rank-order-based 
      priorities using rank order centroids. We compared the 2 sets of priorities using 
      Spearman rank correlation and nonparametric Bland-Altman limits of agreement 
      analysis. We assessed the differential impact of using the rank-order-based 
      versus the AHP-based priorities on the results of a full MCDA comparing 3 
      currently recommended colorectal cancer screening strategies. Generalizability of 
      the results was assessed using Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: Correlations 
      between the 2 sets of priorities for the 7 criteria ranged from 0.55 to 0.92. The 
      proportions of differences between rank-order-based and AHP-based priorities that 
      were more than ±0.15 ranged from 1% to 16%. Differences in the full MCDA results 
      were minimal, and the relative rankings of the 3 screening options were identical 
      more than 88% of the time. The Monte Carlo simulation results were similar. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Rank-order-based MCDA could be a simple, practical way to guide 
      individual decisions and assess population decision priorities regarding 
      colorectal cancer screening strategies. Additional research is warranted to 
      further explore the use of these methods for promoting shared decision making.

TI  - Dengue risk assessment using multicriteria decision analysis: A case study of 
      Bhutan.
PG  - e0009021
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0009021 [doi]
LID - e0009021
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is the most rapidly spreading vector-borne disease globally, 
      with a 30-fold increase in global incidence over the last 50 years. In Bhutan, 
      dengue incidence has been on the rise since 2004, with numerous outbreaks 
      reported across the country. The aim of this study was to identify and map areas 
      that are vulnerable to dengue in Bhutan. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We 
      conducted a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) using a weighted linear 
      combination (WLC) to obtain a vulnerability map of dengue. Risk factors 
      (criteria) were identified and assigned with membership values for vulnerability 
      according to the available literature. Sensitivity analysis and validation of the 
      model was conducted to improve the robustness and predictive ability of the map. 
      Our study revealed marked differences in geographical vulnerability to dengue by 
      location and season. Low-lying areas and those located along the southern border 
      were consistently found to be at higher risk of dengue. The vulnerability 
      extended to higher elevation areas including some areas in the Capital city 
      Thimphu during the summer season. The higher risk was mostly associated with 
      relatively high population density, agricultural and built-up landscapes and 
      relatively good road connectivity. CONCLUSIONS: Using MCDA, our study identified 
      vulnerable areas in Bhutan during specific seasons when and where the 
      transmission of dengue is most likely to occur. This study provides evidence for 
      the National Vector-borne Disease Control programme to optimize the use of 
      limited public health resources for surveillance and vector control, to mitigate 
      the public health threat of dengue.

AB  - Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is increasingly used in health care 
      mainly because it moves decision-making from ad hoc to an evidence-based and 
      comprehensive process. Developing countries with more restricted financial and 
      human research capacities, however, should consider their own methods of MCDA 
      development and implementation. Areas covered: An MCDA framework to improve 
      procurement decisions of off-patent pharmaceuticals was developed for developing 
      countries and adapted to Indonesia, Kazakhstan and Vietnam during three policy 
      workshops. Based on the experience of these workshops and one joint workshop with 
      international experts and decision makers from multiple developing countries, 
      general recommendations were formulated on how to implement MCDA specifically in 
      developing countries. We provide 17 practical MCDA implementation recommendations 
      in four major areas, including (1) MCDA objectives; (2) technical considerations 
      of MCDA tool; (3) development and customization of MCDA tool and (4) policy 
      implementation of MCDA in decision-making. Expert commentary: These practical 
      MCDA recommendations for developing countries contribute to feasible, 
      transparent, stepwise, iterative and standardized decision-making in health care.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of amphotericin B formulations: a network meta-analysis and a 
      multicriteria decision analysis.
PG  - 1672-1683
LID - 10.1111/jphp.12802 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Despite its broad spectrum, conventional amphotericin B (AB) is 
      associated with serious adverse events. Lipid-based formulations may offer safer 
      options. We aimed to synthesize the evidence of efficacy and safety of AB 
      formulations. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis 
      (NMA) to compare all available formulations: conventional AB; lipid complex or 
      ABLC; colloidal dispersion or ABCD; liposomal or LAB; AB in Intralipid. 
      Randomized controlled trials were searched in four databases. Cure, fever, 
      chills, nephrotoxicity, death and drug discontinuation were assessed. NMA was 
      based on Bayesian methods accounting for direct and indirect comparisons. 
      Probability ranks estimating the best formulation were built for each outcome. 
      The relative benefit-risk of formulations was assessed with stochastic 
      multicriteria acceptability analyses (SMAA). KEY FINDINGS: We identified 25 
      trials (n = 2996). No significant differences among drugs were observed for cure 
      or death. All lipid-based formulations were safer than conventional AB for 
      nephrotoxicity. AB-Intralipid was more tolerable than conventional AB and caused 
      less chills than ABCD. AB-Intralipid was the best therapy (>60%) regarding 
      nephrotoxicity, fever, chills and discontinuation. The scenario from SMAA 
      favoured AB-Intralipid (81% acceptability). Conventional AB was secondary to all 
      lipid-based formulations. CONCLUSIONS: Amphotericin B-Intralipid was identified 
      as safer, cost-saving treatment in comparison with other formulations.

TI  - Using multicriteria decision analysis during drug development to predict 
      reimbursement decisions.
PG  - 25270
LID - 10.3402/jmahp.v2.25270 [doi]
LID - 25270
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pharmaceutical companies design clinical development programs to 
      generate the data that they believe will support reimbursement for the 
      experimental compound. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to present a 
      process for using multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) by a pharmaceutical 
      company to estimate the probability of a positive recommendation for 
      reimbursement for a new drug given drug and environmental attributes. METHODS: 
      The MCDA process included 1) selection of decisions makers who were 
      representative of those making reimbursement decisions in a specific country; 2) 
      two pre-workshop questionnaires to identify the most important attributes and 
      their relative importance for a positive recommendation for a new drug; 3) a 
      1-day workshop during which participants undertook three tasks: i) they agreed on 
      a final list of decision attributes and their importance weights, ii) they 
      developed level descriptions for these attributes and mapped each attribute level 
      to a value function, and iii) they developed profiles for hypothetical products 
      'just likely to be reimbursed'; and 4) use of the data from the workshop to 
      develop a prediction algorithm based on a logistic regression analysis. The MCDA 
      process is illustrated using case studies for three countries, the United 
      Kingdom, Germany, and Spain. The extent to which the prediction algorithms for 
      each country captured the decision processes for the workshop participants in our 
      case studies was tested using a post-meeting questionnaire that asked the 
      participants to make recommendations for a set of hypothetical products. RESULTS: 
      The data collected in the case study workshops resulted in a prediction 
      algorithm: 1) for the United Kingdom, the probability of a positive 
      recommendation for different ranges of cost-effectiveness ratios; 2) for Spain, 
      the probability of a positive recommendation at the national and regional levels; 
      and 3) for Germany, the probability of a determination of clinical benefit. The 
      results from the post-meeting questionnaire revealed a high predictive value for 
      the algorithm developed using MCDA. CONCLUSIONS: Prediction algorithms developed 
      using MCDA could be used by pharmaceutical companies when designing their 
      clinical development programs to estimate the likelihood of a favourable 
      reimbursement recommendation for different product profiles and for different 
      positions in the treatment pathway.

TI  - Use of multicriteria decision analysis to address conservation conflicts.
PG  - 936-44
LID - 10.1111/cobi.12090 [doi]
AB  - Conservation conflicts are increasing on a global scale and instruments for 
      reconciling competing interests are urgently needed. Multicriteria decision 
      analysis (MCDA) is a structured, decision-support process that can facilitate 
      dialogue between groups with differing interests and incorporate human and 
      environmental dimensions of conflict. MCDA is a structured and transparent method 
      of breaking down complex problems and incorporating multiple objectives. The 
      value of this process for addressing major challenges in conservation conflict 
      management is that MCDA helps in setting realistic goals; entails a transparent 
      decision-making process; and addresses mistrust, differing world views, 
      cross-scale issues, patchy or contested information, and inflexible legislative 
      tools. Overall we believe MCDA provides a valuable decision-support tool, 
      particularly for increasing awareness of the effects of particular values and 
      choices for working toward negotiated compromise, although an awareness of the 
      effect of methodological choices and the limitations of the method is vital 
      before applying it in conflict situations.

TI  - Early Access to Medicines: Use of Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) as a 
      Decision Tool in Catalonia (Spain).
LID - 10.3390/jcm11051353 [doi]
LID - 1353
AB  - Early access to medicines allows the prescription of a medicine before it is 
      available in the public formulary to patients with severe or rare diseases with 
      high unmet needs who have no authorised therapeutic alternatives available. In 
      this context, consistent decision making is difficult, and a systematic 
      assessment procedure could be useful to tackle complex situations and guarantee 
      the equity of medicines' access. A multidisciplinary panel (MP) conducted four 
      workshops to develop an early access framework based on a reflective multiple 
      criteria decision analysis (MCDA). A set of 12 criteria was agreed: eight 
      quantitative (severity of disease, urgency, efficacy, safety, internal and 
      external validity, therapeutic benefit and plausibility) and four qualitative 
      (therapeutic alternative, existence of precedents, management impact and costs). 
      Quantitative criteria were weighted using a five-point scale. The relative 
      importance of quantitative criteria had mean weights from 4.7 to 3.6, showing its 
      relevance in the decisions. The framework was tested using two case studies, and 
      reliability was assessed by re-test. The re-test revealed no statistical 
      differences, indicating the consistency and replicability of the framework 
      developed. MCDA may help to structure discussions for heterogeneous treatment 
      requests, providing predictability and robustness in decision making involving 
      sensitive and complex situations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recent years have witnessed an increased interest in the use of 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) to support health technology assessment 
      (HTA) agencies for setting healthcare priorities. However, its implementation to 
      date has been criticized for being "entirely mechanistic," ignoring opportunity 
      costs, and not following best practice guidelines. This article provides guidance 
      on the use of MCDA in this context. METHODS: The present study was based on a 
      systematic review and consensus development. We developed a typology of MCDA 
      studies and good implementation practice. We reviewed 36 studies over the period 
      1990 to 2018 on their compliance with good practice and developed 
      recommendations. We reached consensus among authors over the course of several 
      review rounds. RESULTS: We identified 3 MCDA study types: qualitative MCDA, 
      quantitative MCDA, and MCDA with decision rules. The types perform differently in 
      terms of quality, consistency, and transparency of recommendations on healthcare 
      priorities. We advise HTA agencies to always include a deliberative component. 
      Agencies should, at a minimum, undertake qualitative MCDA. The use of 
      quantitative MCDA has additional benefits but also poses design challenges. MCDA 
      with decision rules, used by HTA agencies in The Netherlands and the United 
      Kingdom and typically referred to as structured deliberation, has the potential 
      to further improve the formulation of recommendations but has not yet been 
      subjected to broad experimentation and evaluation. CONCLUSION: MCDA holds large 
      potential to support HTA agencies in setting healthcare priorities, but its 
      implementation needs to be improved.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To test the ability of a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) model 
      to incorporate disparate data sources of varying quality along with clinical 
      judgement in a benefit-risk assessment of six well-known pain-relief drugs. 
      METHODS: Six over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics were evaluated against three 
      favourable effects and eight unfavourable effects by seven experts who specialise 
      in the relief of pain, two in a 2-day facilitated workshop whose input data and 
      judgements were later peer-reviewed by five additional experts. KEY FINDINGS: 
      Ibuprofen salts and solubilised emerged with the best benefit-risk profile, 
      followed by naproxen, ibuprofen acid, diclofenac, paracetamol and aspirin. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Multicriteria decision analysis enabled participants to evaluate the 
      OTC analgesics against a range of favourable and unfavourable effects in a group 
      setting that enabled all issues to be openly aired and debated. The model was 
      easily communicated and understood by the peer reviewers, so the model should be 
      comprehensible to physicians, pharmacists and other health professionals.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop a simple approach for evaluating the overall benefit-risk 
      of a new noninferiority treatment compared with a standard of care. METHODS: We 
      propose using multicriteria decision analysis that accounts for uncertainty 
      associated with both clinical outcomes and patient preference data. Because 
      patients' preferences are likely to be influenced by their baseline 
      characteristics, we suggest carrying out a preference study at the beginning of a 
      trial. To reduce the burden of an additional study questionnaire, preference 
      elicitation could be done on a small sample of trial participants. To restore 
      preferences for all trial participants, we propose using multiple imputation 
      (MI). Using simulations, we examine whether 3 different MI procedures lead to the 
      same benefit-risk assessment conclusion, as if all trial participant preferences 
      were obtained. We also compare MI results to complete case analysis, where only 
      preferences of the small sample of trial participants are considered. RESULTS: We 
      show that the MI procedure successfully restores patients' preferences for the 
      trial participants using different outcome criteria and preferences. For example, 
      using 3 outcome criteria with only 10% of the trial participants providing their 
      preferences, complete case analysis demonstrated a new noninferior treatment as 
      favorable only 5.1% of the time, whereas MI procedures did so between 16.2% and 
      17.9% of the time. Given that 17.6% correspond to the fully observed weights, the 
      MI methods demonstrate favorable results. CONCLUSIONS: The MI procedure can help 
      facilitate a simple comprehensive benefit-risk assessment for new noninferior 
      treatments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Decision on the most appropriate oral anticoagulation therapy for 
      stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is difficult 
      because multiple treatment options are available, and these vary in their 
      clinical effects and relevant nonclinical characteristics. OBJECTIVES: To use a 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) to compare the oral anticoagulants 
      apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, and vitamin K antagonist (VKAs; 
      specifically warfarin) in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. METHODS: 
      We identified the evaluation criteria through a targeted literature review and 
      clinical judgment. The final evaluation model included nine clinical events and 
      four other criteria. We ranked possibly fatal clinical event criteria on the 
      basis of the differences in risks of fatal events and the corresponding window of 
      therapeutic opportunity, as observed in clinical trials. Clinical judgment was 
      used to rank other criteria. Full criteria ranking was used to calculate centroid 
      weights, which were combined with individual treatment performances to estimate 
      the overall value score for each treatment. RESULTS: Using such an MCDA, 
      dabigatran yielded the highest overall value, approximately 6% higher than that 
      of the second-best treatment, apixaban. Dabigatran also had the highest 
      first-rank probability (0.72) in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis. 
      Rivaroxaban performed worse than the other non-VKA oral anticoagulants, but 
      better than VKAs (with both having 0.00 first-rank probability). The results were 
      insensitive to changes in model structure. CONCLUSIONS: When all key oral 
      anticoagulant value criteria and their relative importance are investigated in an 
      MCDA, dabigatran appears to rank the highest and warfarin the lowest.

TI  - Multicriteria decision analysis process to develop new classification criteria 
      for systemic lupus erythematosus.
PG  - 634-640
LID - 10.1136/annrheumdis-2018-214685 [doi]
AB  - European League Against Rheumatism and are jointly supporting multiphase 
      development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) classification criteria based 
      on weighted criteria and a continuous probability scale. Prior steps included 
      item generation, item reduction and hierarchical organisation of candidate 
      criteria using an evidence-based approach. Our objectives were to determine 
      relative weights using multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) and to set a 
      provisional threshold score for SLE classification. An SLE Expert Panel (8 
      European, 9 North American) submitted 164 real, unique cases with a wide range of 
      SLE probability in a standardised format. Using the candidate criteria, experts 
      scored and rank-ordered 20 representative cases. At an in-person meeting, experts 
      reviewed inter-rater reliability of scoring, further refined criteria definitions 
      and participated in an MCDA exercise. Based on expert consensus decisions on 
      pairwise comparisons of criteria, 1000minds software calculated criteria weights 
      and rank-ordered the remaining 144 cases based on their additive scores. The 
      score of the lowest-ranked case for which complete expert consensus was achieved 
      defined the provisional threshold classification score. Inter-rater reliability 
      of scoring cases with the candidate criteria was good. MCDA involved 74 pairwise 
      decisions and was repeated for the arthritis and mucocutaneous domains when the 
      initial ranking of some cases did not match expert opinion. After criteria 
      weights and additive scores were recalculated once, experts reached consensus for 
      SLE classification for all cases scoring>83. Using an iterative process, the 
      candidate criteria definitions were refined, preliminary weights were calculated 
      and a provisional threshold score for SLE classification was determined.

TI  - Implementing reflective multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) to assess orphan 
      drugs value in the Catalan Health Service (CatSalut).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Orphan medicines show some characteristics that hinder the evaluation 
      of their clinical added value. The often low level of evidence available for 
      orphan drugs, together with a high budget impact and an incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratio many times higher than drugs used for non-orphan 
      diseases, represent challenges in their appraisal and effective access to 
      clinical use. In order to explore how to handle these hurdles, the Catalan Health 
      Service (CatSalut) began an initiative on a multidimensional assessment of drugs 
      value during the appraisal process. Reflective multicriteria decision analysis 
      (MCDA) using analytical methods was chosen, since it may help to standardise and 
      contextualize all the relevant data related with the drug that could contribute 
      to a decision. The aim of the study was to determine whether the implementation 
      of reflective MCDA methodology could support the decision-making process about 
      orphan medicines in the context of CatSalut. METHODS: The assessment and 
      decision-making process for orphan drugs in the Programa d'Harmonització 
      Farmacoterapeutica (PHF) of CatSalut was prioritized to test the implementation 
      of the reflective MCDA both a qualitative and quantitatively. A staged approach 
      was used with the following main steps: selection and structuration of 
      quantitative criteria (Core Model) and qualitative criteria (Contextual Tool), 
      framework scoring and assessment of three orphan drug case studies. This 
      proof-of-concept would grant a continued refinement of the methodology and, if 
      and when validated, its potential integration to other therapeutic areas of the 
      PHF. RESULTS: The final framework was composed by 10 quantitative criteria (Core 
      Model) and 4 qualitative criteria (Contextual Tool) according to the PHF goals 
      being the most important criteria "disease severity", "unmet need", "comparative 
      effectiveness" and "comparative safety /tolerability". The matrix developed for 
      the case studies served as a guide for the selection of the essential information 
      that the decision-makers were expected to include in a framework. The reflective 
      discussion was considered the most relevant phase of the approach to support 
      inputs for health decision-making processes reflecting both drug value and place 
      in therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that reflective MCDA methodology could 
      be implemented to complement the decision-making process in CatSalut, as an aid 
      to determine the clinical added value for orphan medicines. MCDA provided 
      transparency and a structured discussion during the committee meetings, thus 
      increasing transparency and predictability of the relevant items supporting the 
      agreements adopted on orphan drugs access.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Patient involvement in drug evaluation decision making is increasing. 
      The aim of the current study was to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis 
      (MCDA) framework that would enable the inclusion of the patient perspective in 
      the selection of appropriate criteria for MCDAs being used in the value 
      assessments of oncologic drugs. METHODS: A literature review was conducted to 
      identify and define criteria used in drug assessments from patient perspectives. 
      The Evidence and Value: Impact on Decision Making methodology was used to develop 
      a MCDA framework. Identified criteria were discussed by a sample of oncology 
      patient association representatives who decided which criteria were important 
      from patient perspectives. Selected criteria were rated by importance. The 
      preliminary MCDA framework was tested through the assessment of a hypothetical 
      oncology treatment. A discussion was carried out to agree on a final pilot MCDA 
      framework. RESULTS: Twenty-two criteria were extracted from the literature 
      review. After criteria discussion, sixteen criteria remained. The most important 
      criteria were comparative patient reported outcomes (PRO), comparative efficacy 
      and disease severity. After the discussion generated by the scoring of the 
      hypothetical oncology treatment, the final pilot MCDA framework included seven 
      quantitative criteria ("disease severity", "unmet needs", "comparative efficacy / 
      effectiveness", "comparative safety / tolerability", "comparative PROs", 
      "contribution of oncological innovation") and one contextual criterion 
      ("population priorities and access"). CONCLUSIONS: The present study developed a 
      pilot reflective MCDA framework that could increase patient's capability to 
      participate in the decision-making process by providing systematic drug 
      assessments from the patient perspective.

TI  - A multicriteria decision analysis model and risk assessment framework for carbon 
      capture and storage.
PG  - 1720-37
LID - 10.1111/risa.12211 [doi]
AB  - Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) has been applied to various energy 
      problems to incorporate a variety of qualitative and quantitative criteria, 
      usually spanning environmental, social, engineering, and economic fields. MCDA 
      and associated methods such as life-cycle assessments and cost-benefit analysis 
      can also include risk analysis to address uncertainties in criteria estimates. 
      One technology now being assessed to help mitigate climate change is carbon 
      capture and storage (CCS). CCS is a new process that captures CO2 emissions from 
      fossil-fueled power plants and injects them into geological reservoirs for 
      storage. It presents a unique challenge to decisionmakers (DMs) due to its 
      technical complexity, range of environmental, social, and economic impacts, 
      variety of stakeholders, and long time spans. The authors have developed a risk 
      assessment model using a MCDA approach for CCS decisions such as selecting 
      between CO2 storage locations and choosing among different mitigation actions for 
      reducing risks. The model includes uncertainty measures for several factors, 
      utility curve representations of all variables, Monte Carlo simulation, and 
      sensitivity analysis. This article uses a CCS scenario example to demonstrate the 
      development and application of the model based on data derived from published 
      articles and publicly available sources. The model allows high-level DMs to 
      better understand project risks and the tradeoffs inherent in modern, complex 
      energy decisions.

TI  - Site selection of municipal solid waste incineration plant using GIS and 
      multicriteria decision analysis.
PG  - 1027-1039
LID - 10.1080/10962247.2022.2064002 [doi]
AB  - Fast population growth and urbanization has increased the generation of municipal 
      solid waste in Oman. Currently, Oman relies on landfills to handle growing 
      amounts of waste, which has burdened the existing solid waste management 
      infrastructure. This situation calls for establishing incineration plants that 
      can considerably reduce the volume of waste, and can simultaneously produce 
      electricity. However, one of the crucial steps in the planning of an incineration 
      plant is the selection of an appropriate site that can overcome environmental and 
      economic implications and eliminate community dissatisfaction. Therefore, to 
      select an optimal site for incineration plant in Muscat and South Batinah 
      governorates, where landfills receive the highest waste amounts per day, this 
      research identified 11 criteria that cover the environmental, economic, and 
      social concerns. These criteria were processed by combining the multicriteria 
      decision making (MCDM) method and geographical information system (GIS) software 
      where the suitability of individual criteria were evaluated and then integrated 
      using the weighted overlay analysis to generate a final suitability map for 
      incineration site selection. The final suitability map indicated that only 2% of 
      the land is suitable for setting up an incineration plant in the study area, and 
      the most suitable location with adequate area was found in Barka wilaya of South 
      Batinah governorate.Implications: Due to the escalation in MSW generation, Oman 
      is looking for alternative strategies to reduce the volume of MSW. This has led 
      to country's interest in establishing a waste-to-energy plant (particularly 
      incineration) in the future. However, locating a suitable site for the 
      installation of an MSW incineration plant in Oman has never been studied before. 
      Therefore, to bridge the gap in knowledge, this research focuses on selecting a 
      suitable site for a municipal solid waste incineration plant using GIS and 
      multicriteria decision analysis. This study highlights the suitability of Muscat 
      and North Batinah governorates of Oman where landfills receive huge amounts of 
      MSW on a daily basis and are close to becoming saturated. Moreover, the 
      suitability of land in both governorates is assessed to overcome environmental 
      and economic implications and eliminate community dissatisfaction. This research 
      not only provides the level of suitability of land in both governorates, but also 
      selects a suitable site, which will be beneficial for the government of Oman in 
      future when making a decision regarding the location of the plant.

AB  - Wild pigs are a widespread invasive species that pose significant environmental 
      and social risks. A number of wild pig eradication and control measures exist, 
      but many eradication campaigns are ultimately unsuccessful. Decision making 
      regarding how to design and execute an eradication plan is difficult because of 
      multiple costs and benefits spanning various decision criteria that are 
      associated with different eradication and control countermeasures. Moreover, 
      multiple stakeholders are often involved with differing and sometimes competing 
      objectives, and wild pigs are adaptive adversaries, meaning that the ideal 
      countermeasure may change over time. In this paper, we propose the use of formal 
      decision analytic tools which can structure decision problems into a set of 
      relevant criteria, countermeasures, and stakeholder preferences to facilitate the 
      evaluation of tradeoffs. We operationalize this method in a simple Excel-based 
      decision tool and conclude with a path forward regarding how to successfully 
      implement such tools for effective wild pig control.

TI  - Comparison of weighting methods used in multicriteria decision analysis 
      frameworks in healthcare with focus on low- and middle-income countries.

AB  - AIM: Criteria weighting is a key element of multicriteria decision analysis that 
      is becoming extensively used in healthcare decision-making. In our narrative 
      review we describe the advantages and disadvantages of various weighting methods. 
      METHODS: An assessment of the eight identified primary criteria weighting methods 
      was compiled on domains including their resource requirements, and potential for 
      bias. RESULTS: In general, we found more complex methods to have less potential 
      for bias; however, resource intensity and general participant burden is greater 
      for these methods. CONCLUSION: The selection of the most appropriate method 
      depends on the decision-making context. The simple multiattribute rating 
      technique (SMART) method combined with swing-weighting technique and the analytic 
      hierarchy process methods may be the most feasible approaches for low- and 
      middle-income countries.

TI  - Multicriteria decision analysis: a comprehensive decision approach for management 
      of contaminated sediments.
PG  - 61-78
AB  - Contaminated sediments and other sites present a difficult challenge for 
      environmental decisionmakers. They are typically slow to recover or attenuate 
      naturally, may involve multiple regulatory agencies and stakeholder groups, and 
      engender multiple toxicological and ecotoxicological risks. While environmental 
      decision-making strategies over the last several decades have evolved into 
      increasingly more sophisticated, information-intensive, and complex approaches, 
      there remains considerable dissatisfaction among business, industry, and the 
      public with existing management strategies. Consequently, contaminated sediments 
      and materials are the subject of intense technology development, such as 
      beneficial reuse or in situ treatment. However, current decision analysis 
      approaches, such as comparative risk assessment, benefit-cost analysis, and life 
      cycle assessment, do not offer a comprehensive approach for incorporating the 
      varied types of information and multiple stakeholder and public views that must 
      typically be brought to bear when new technologies are under consideration. 
      Alternatively, multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) offers a scientifically 
      sound decision framework for management of contaminated materials or sites where 
      stakeholder participation is of crucial concern and criteria such as economics, 
      environmental impacts, safety, and risk cannot be easily condensed into simple 
      monetary expressions. This article brings together a multidisciplinary review of 
      existing decision-making approaches at regulatory agencies in the United States 
      and Europe and synthesizes state-of-the-art research in MCDA methods applicable 
      to the assessment of contaminated sediment management technologies. Additionally, 
      it tests an MCDA approach for coupling expert judgment and stakeholder values in 
      a hypothetical contaminated sediments management case study wherein MCDA is used 
      as a tool for testing stakeholder responses to and improving expert assessment of 
      innovative contaminated sediments technologies.

TI  - A Multiple Stakeholder Multicriteria Decision Analysis in Diabetic Macular Edema 
      Management: The MULTIDEX-EMD Study.
PG  - 615-624
LID - 10.1007/s41669-020-00201-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical and economic management of retinal diseases has become 
      more complex following the introduction of new intravitreal treatments. 
      Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) offers the potential to overcome the 
      challenges associated with traditional decision-making tools. OBJECTIVES: A MCDA 
      to determine the most relevant criteria to decision-making in the management of 
      diabetic macular edema (DME) based on the perspectives of multiple stakeholders 
      in Spain was developed. This MCDA was termed the MULTIDEX-EMD study. METHODS: 
      Nineteen stakeholders (7 physicians, 4 pharmacists, 5 health authorities and 
      health management experts, 1 psychologist, and 2 patient representatives) 
      participated in this three-phase project. In phase A, an advisory board defined 
      all of the criteria that could influence DME treatment decision-making. These 
      criteria were then screened using a discrete choice experiment (DCE) (phase B). 
      Next, a multinomial logit model was fitted by applying the backward elimination 
      algorithm (relevant criteria: p value < 0.05). Finally, the results were 
      discussed in a deliberative process (phase C). RESULTS: Thirty-one criteria were 
      initially defined (phase A) and grouped into 5 categories: 
      efficacy/effectiveness, safety, organizational and economic impact, 
      patient-reported outcomes, and other therapeutic features. The DCE results (phase 
      B) showed that 10 criteria were relevant to the decision-making process for a 50- 
      to 65-year-old DME patient: mean change in best corrected visual acuity (p 
      value < 0.001), percentage of patients with an improvement of ≥ 15 letters (p 
      value < 0.001), effect duration per administration (p value = 0.008), retinal 
      detachment (p value < 0.001), endophthalmitis (p value = 0.012), myocardial 
      infarction (p value < 0.001), intravitreal hemorrhage (p value = 0.021), annual 
      treatment cost per patient (p value = 0.001), health-related quality of life 
      (HRQoL) (p value = 0.004), and disability level (p value = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: 
      From a multi-stakeholder perspective, the selection of an appropriate treatment 
      for DME patients should guarantee patient safety and maximize the visual acuity 
      improvement and treatment effect duration. It should also contribute to system 
      sustainability by being affordable, it should have a positive impact on HRQoL, 
      and it should prevent disability.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Classification criteria for systemic sclerosis (SSc) are being 
      developed. The objectives were to develop an instrument for collating case data 
      and evaluate its sensibility; use forced-choice methods to reduce and weight 
      criteria; and explore agreement among experts on the probability that cases were 
      classified as SSc. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A standardized instrument was tested 
      for sensibility. The instrument was applied to 20 cases covering a range of 
      probabilities that each had SSc. Experts rank ordered cases from highest to 
      lowest probability; reduced and weighted the criteria using forced-choice 
      methods; and reranked the cases. Consistency in rankings was evaluated using 
      intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). RESULTS: Experts endorsed clarity 
      (83%), comprehensibility (100%), face and content validity (100%). Criteria were 
      weighted (points): finger skin thickening (14-22), fingertip lesions (9-21), 
      friction rubs (21), finger flexion contractures (16), pulmonary fibrosis (14), 
      SSc-related antibodies (15), Raynaud phenomenon (13), calcinosis (12), pulmonary 
      hypertension (11), renal crisis (11), telangiectasia (10), abnormal nailfold 
      capillaries (10), esophageal dilation (7), and puffy fingers (5). The ICC across 
      experts was 0.73 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.58, 0.86] and improved to 0.80 
      (95% CI: 0.68, 0.90). CONCLUSIONS: Using a sensible instrument and forced-choice 
      methods, the number of criteria were reduced by 39% (range, 23-14) and weighted. 
      Our methods reflect the rigors of measurement science and serve as a template for 
      developing classification criteria.

TI  - A simple way to unify multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) and stochastic 
      multicriteria acceptability analysis (SMAA) using a Dirichlet distribution in 
      benefit-risk assessment.
PG  - 567-578
LID - 10.1002/bimj.201600113 [doi]
AB  - Quantitative methodologies have been proposed to support decision making in drug 
      development and monitoring. In particular, multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) 
      and stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis (SMAA) are useful tools to 
      assess the benefit-risk ratio of medicines according to the performances of the 
      treatments on several criteria, accounting for the preferences of the decision 
      makers regarding the relative importance of these criteria. However, even in its 
      probabilistic form, MCDA requires the exact elicitations of the weights of the 
      criteria by the decision makers, which may be difficult to achieve in practice. 
      SMAA allows for more flexibility and can be used with unknown or partially known 
      preferences, but it is less popular due to its increased complexity and the high 
      degree of uncertainty in its results. In this paper, we propose a simple model as 
      a generalization of MCDA and SMAA, by applying a Dirichlet distribution to the 
      weights of the criteria and by making its parameters vary. This unique model 
      permits to fit both MCDA and SMAA, and allows for a more extended exploration of 
      the benefit-risk assessment of treatments. The precision of its results depends 
      on the precision parameter of the Dirichlet distribution, which could be 
      naturally interpreted as the strength of confidence of the decision makers in 
      their elicitation of preferences.

TI  - Evaluation of Multicriteria Decision Analysis Algorithms in Food Safety: A Case 
      Study on Emerging Zoonoses Prioritization.
PG  - 336-351
LID - 10.1111/risa.13391 [doi]
AB  - Decision making in food safety is a complex process that involves several 
      criteria of different nature like the expected reduction in the number of 
      illnesses, the potential economic or health-related cost, or even the 
      environmental impact of a given policy or intervention. Several multicriteria 
      decision analysis (MCDA) algorithms are currently used, mostly individually, in 
      food safety to rank different options in a multifactorial environment. However, 
      the selection of the MCDA algorithm is a decision problem on its own because 
      different methods calculate different rankings. The aim of this study was to 
      compare the impact of different uncertainty sources on the rankings of MCDA 
      problems in the context of food safety. For that purpose, a previously published 
      data set on emerging zoonoses in the Netherlands was used to compare different 
      MCDA algorithms: MMOORA, TOPSIS, VIKOR, WASPAS, and ELECTRE III. The rankings 
      were calculated with and without considering uncertainty (using fuzzy sets), to 
      assess the importance of this factor. The rankings obtained differed between 
      algorithms, emphasizing that the selection of the MCDA method had a relevant 
      impact in the rankings. Furthermore, considering uncertainty in the ranking had a 
      high influence on the results. Both factors were more relevant than the weights 
      associated with each criterion in this case study. A hierarchical clustering 
      method was suggested to aggregate results obtained by the different algorithms. 
      This complementary step seems to be a promising way to decrease extreme 
      difference among algorithms and could provide a strong added value in the 
      decision-making process.

TI  - Discrepancies between multicriteria decision analysis-based ranking and intuitive 
      ranking for pharmaceutical benefit-risk profiles in a hypothetical setting.
PG  - 80-86
LID - 10.1111/jcpt.12486 [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) has been 
      generally considered a promising decision-making methodology for the assessment 
      of drug benefit-risk profiles. There have been many discussions in both public 
      and private sectors on its feasibility and applicability, but it has not been 
      employed in official decision-makings. For the purpose of examining to what 
      extent MCDA would reflect the first-hand, intuitive preference of evaluators in 
      practical pharmaceutical assessments, we conducted a questionnaire survey 
      involving the participation of employees of pharmaceutical companies. METHODS: 
      Showing profiles of the efficacy and safety of four hypothetical drugs, each 
      respondent was asked to rank them following the standard MCDA process and then to 
      rank them intuitively (i.e. without applying any analytical framework). RESULTS 
      AND DISCUSSION: These two approaches resulted in substantially different ranking 
      patterns from the same individuals, and the concordance rate was surprisingly low 
      (17%). Although many respondents intuitively showed a preference for mild, 
      balanced risk-benefit profiles over profiles with a conspicuous advantage in 
      either risk or benefit, the ranking orders based on MCDA scores did not reflect 
      the intuitive preference. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Observed discrepancies 
      between the rankings seemed to be primarily attributed to the structural 
      characteristics of MCDA, which assumes that evaluation on each benefit and risk 
      component should have monotonic impact on final scores. It would be difficult for 
      MCDA to reflect commonly observed non-monotonic preferences for risk and benefit 
      profiles. Possible drawbacks of MCDA should be further investigated prior to the 
      real-world application of its benefit-risk assessment.

AB  - The study presents the possibility of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) 
      application when choosing analytical procedures with low environmental impact. A 
      type of MCDA, Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations 
      (PROMETHEE), was chosen as versatile tool that meets all the analytical 
      chemists--decision makers requirements. Twenty five analytical procedures for 
      aldrin determination in water samples (as an example) were selected as input 
      alternatives to MCDA analysis. Nine different criteria describing the 
      alternatives were chosen from different groups--metrological, economical and the 
      most importantly--environmental impact. The weights for each criterion were 
      obtained from questionnaires that were sent to experts, giving three different 
      scenarios for MCDA results. The results of analysis show that PROMETHEE is very 
      promising tool to choose the analytical procedure with respect to its greenness. 
      The rankings for all three scenarios placed solid phase microextraction and 
      liquid phase microextraction--based procedures high, while liquid-liquid 
      extraction, solid phase extraction and stir bar sorptive extraction--based 
      procedures were placed low in the ranking. The results show that although some of 
      the experts do not intentionally choose green analytical chemistry procedures, 
      their MCDA choice is in accordance with green chemistry principles. The PROMETHEE 
      ranking results were compared with more widely accepted green analytical 
      chemistry tools--NEMI and Eco-Scale. As PROMETHEE involved more different factors 
      than NEMI, the assessment results were only weakly correlated. Oppositely, the 
      results of Eco-Scale assessment were well-correlated as both methodologies 
      involved similar criteria of assessment.

TI  - A multicriteria decision analysis framework for developing and evaluating coastal 
      retreat policy.
PG  - 83-98
LID - 10.1002/ieam.4662 [doi]
AB  - Managed retreat may be a necessity for coastal communities as sea levels rise due 
      to climate change. Selecting the right policy decisions and timing is difficult 
      given the vested interests of communities and stakeholder groups and requires 
      careful balancing of the benefits and risks associated with each management 
      alternative. State and federal agencies often employ single-objective 
      optimization frameworks such as cost-benefit analysis to analyze coastal 
      relocation alternatives, but such methods are limited in their ability to balance 
      competing value considerations and stakeholder demands. The use of a 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) methodology allows for such considerations 
      to be quantified and evaluated, thereby improving planning and decision-making 
      for coastal retreat policies. This paper provides a strategic MCDA framework to 
      evaluate coastal retreat policy that could be leveraged by at-risk coastal 
      communities. The MCDA is applied to a hypothetical coastal retreat scenario to 
      visualize policy preferences and differing value considerations among 
      stakeholders. This model can be used by government agencies to foster more sound,

TI  - Applying Reflective Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to Patient-Clinician 
      Shared Decision-Making on the Management of Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine 
      Tumors (GEP-NET) in the Spanish Context.
PG  - 1215-1231
LID - 10.1007/s12325-018-0745-6 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Unresectable, well-differentiated nonfunctioning 
      gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) can be monitored 
      (watchful waiting, WW) or treated with systemic therapy such as somatostatin 
      analogues (SSAs) to delay progression. We applied a reflective multicriteria 
      decision analysis (MCDA) shared-decision framework (previously developed for the 
      USA) to explore what matters to Spanish patients and clinicians considering 
      GEP-NET treatment options. METHODS: The EVIDEM-derived framework was updated and 
      adapted to the Spanish context. During a Chatham House session, five patients and 
      six physicians assigned criteria weights using hierarchical point allocation and 
      direct rating scale (alternative analysis). Informed by synthesized evidence 
      embedded in the framework, participants scored how each criterion favored SSA 
      treatment (reference case lanreotide) or WW and shared insights and knowledge. 
      Weights and scores were combined into value contributions (norm. 
      weight × score/5), which were added across criteria to derive the relative 
      benefit-risk balance (RBRB, scale - 1 to + 1). Exploratory comparisons to US 
      study findings were performed. RESULTS: Focusing on intervention outcomes 
      (effectiveness, patient-reported, and safety), the mean RBRB favored treatment 
      over WW (+ 0.32 ± 0.24), with the largest contributions from progression-free 
      survival (+ 0.11 ± SD 0.07), fatal adverse events (+ 0.06 ± SD 0.08), and impact 
      on HRQoL (+ 0.04 ± SD 0.04). Consideration of modulating criteria (type of 
      benefit, need, costs, evidence, and feasibility) increased the RBRB to 
      + 0.50 ± 0.14, with type of therapeutic benefit (+ 0.10 ± SD 0.08) and quality of 
      evidence (+ 0.08 ± SD 0.06) contributing most towards treatment. Alternative 
      weighting yielded similar results. Results were broadly comparable to those 
      derived from the US study. CONCLUSION: The multicriteria framework helped Spanish 
      patients and clinicians identify and express what matters to them. The approach 
      is transferable across decision-making contexts. FUNDING: IPSEN Pharma.

TI  - Using multicriteria decision analysis to support research priority setting in 
      biomedical translational research projects.

AB  - Translational research is conducted to achieve a predefined set of economic or 
      societal goals. As a result, investment decisions on where available resources 
      have the highest potential in achieving these goals have to be made. In this 
      paper, we first describe how multicriteria decision analysis can assist in 
      defining the decision context and in ensuring that all relevant aspects of the 
      decision problem are incorporated in the decision making process. We then present 
      the results of a case study to support priority setting in a translational 
      research consortium aimed at reducing the burden of disease of type 2 diabetes. 
      During problem structuring, we identified four research alternatives (primary, 
      secondary, tertiary microvascular, and tertiary macrovascular prevention) and a 
      set of six decision criteria. Scoring of these alternatives against the criteria 
      was done using a combination of expert judgement and previously published data. 
      Lastly, decision analysis was performed using stochastic multicriteria 
      acceptability analysis, which allows for the combined use of numerical and 
      ordinal data. We found that the development of novel techniques applied in 
      secondary prevention would be a poor investment of research funds. The ranking of 
      the remaining alternatives was however strongly dependent on the decision maker's 
      preferences for certain criteria.

TI  - Stakeholder perception of pharmaceutical value: A multicriteria decision analysis 
      pilot case study for value assessment in the United States.
PG  - 1190-1196
LID - 10.18553/jmcp.2022.28.10.1190 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent attention to value frameworks has highlighted limitations of 
      current conventional value and health technology assessment (V/HTA) methods (eg, 
      cost-effectiveness). Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) has potential as a 
      supplemental tool to incorporate additional value criteria into conventional 
      value assessment. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a pilot study to illustrate the impact of 
      an MCDA approach on the value perceptions of hypothetical treatment profiles from 
      a multistakeholder panel. METHODS: Participants voted on value perceptions of 2 
      hypothetical treatments with similar cost-effectiveness evidence: Treatment A for 
      aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adults and treatment B for episodic 
      migraine in adults. Participants voted treatments A and B as low, intermediate, 
      or high value before and after a weighting exercise on prespecified, additional 
      value criteria. Weights from participants were used to calculate 
      treatment-specific MCDA scores from 0 (least favorable) to 100 (most favorable) 
      and were presented to participants for a second value-perception vote. Analyses 
      compared changes in value perceptions within treatments A and B post-MCDA 
      exercise. RESULTS: Before considering MCDA scores for treatment A, 0% of 
      participants considered it to be low, 52% intermediate, and 48% high value. After 
      considering MCDA scores for treatment A, 4% considered it low, 29% intermediate, 
      and 67% high value. Both before and after considering MCDA scores for treatment 
      B, 13%, considered it low, 57% intermediate, and 30% high value. Mean MCDA scores 
      for treatments A and B were 67 and 63, respectively. Of all stakeholders, 41% 
      altered their perception of value for treatment A (9% negatively and 32% 
      positively) and, separately, 45% for treatment B (23% both negatively and 
      positively) after considering MCDA scores. CONCLUSIONS: With nearly half of 
      participants altering their perception of value after consideration of additional 
      value criteria, findings support the need for a more inclusive and flexible value 
      assessment process. DISCLOSURES: This study was funded by The National 
      Pharmaceutical Council. Dr Perfetto was employed by the National Health Council 
      (NHC) at the time this work was completed, and all honoraria and consulting and 
      travel fees were paid to the NHC. The NHC is a not-for-profit, membership

TI  - Combining multicriteria decision analysis, ethics and health technology 
      assessment: applying the EVIDEM decision-making framework to growth hormone for 
      Turner syndrome patients.
PG  - 4
LID - 10.1186/1478-7547-8-4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To test and further develop a healthcare policy and clinical decision 
      support framework using growth hormone (GH) for Turner syndrome (TS) as a complex 
      case study. METHODS: The EVIDEM framework was further developed to complement the 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) Value Matrix, that includes 15 
      quantifiable components of decision clustered in four domains (quality of 
      evidence, disease, intervention and economics), with a qualitative tool including 
      six ethical and health system-related components of decision. An extensive review 
      of the literature was performed to develop a health technology assessment report 
      (HTA) tailored to each component of decision, and content was validated by 
      experts. A panel of representative stakeholders then estimated the MCDA value of 
      GH for TS in Canada by assigning weights and scores to each MCDA component of 
      decision and then considered the impact of non-quantifiable components of 
      decision. RESULTS: Applying the framework revealed significant data gaps and the 
      importance of aligning research questions with data needs to truly inform 
      decision. Panelists estimated the value of GH for TS at 41% of maximum value on 
      the MCDA scale, with good agreement at the individual level (retest value 40%; 
      ICC: 0.687) and large variation across panelists. Main contributors to this panel 
      specific value were "Improvement of efficacy", "Disease severity" and "Quality of 
      evidence". Ethical considerations on utility, efficiency and fairness as well as 
      potential misuse of GH had mixed effects on the perceived value of the treatment. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This framework is proposed as a pragmatic step beyond the current 
      cost-effectiveness model, combining HTA, MCDA, values and ethics. It supports 
      systematic consideration of all components of decision and available evidence for 
      greater transparency. Further testing and validation is needed to build up MCDA 
      approaches combined with pragmatic HTA in healthcare decision-making.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To pilot the use of multicriteria decision analysis to establish and 
      apply a framework of weighted attributes to value orphan medicinal products. 
      METHODS: Literature searches on the natural history and burden of 40 rare 
      diseases and of how payers assess treatment value and three workshops with, 
      respectively, GlaxoSmithKline managers working on orphan medicinal products, 
      European Union clinical and health economics experts, and representatives of rare 
      diseases patient groups in the European Union. RESULTS: Eight nonmonetary 
      attributes were identified and weights agreed: four concern the disease being 
      treated and four the treatment itself. About half of the weight went to 
      attributes of the disease treated and half to attributes of the treatment. 
      Patient group representatives gave greater weight than did the experts to 
      patients' and carers' quality of daily life. CONCLUSIONS: The multicriteria 
      decision analysis approach piloted works and could be developed for use by payers 
      and health technology assessment bodies.

AB  - PURPOSE: Several frameworks have been developed to define and quantify the value 
      of oncologic therapies and to support decision making; however, they define 
      treatment value mainly in terms of clinical benefit. As part of its mission to 
      improve oncologic care, the ECO Foundation (Excellence and Quality in Oncology) 
      directed this pilot study aimed at developing a reflective multicriteria decision 
      analysis (MCDA)-based framework for evaluating and positioning oncologic drugs in 
      the clinical setting. METHODS: The framework was developed following Evidence and 
      Value: Impact on Decision-Making methodology, and literature was reviewed to 
      identify relevant criteria. The selected criteria were then presented to a group 
      of experts composed of 9 clinical oncologists who assessed each criterion for 
      inclusion in the framework and suggested modifications in their definition and/or 
      response scale. The framework was tested in 2 case studies (abemaciclib for 
      advanced or metastatic hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor 
      receptor 2-negative breast cancer and TAS-102 for metastatic colorectal cancer) 
      to validate the proposed framework; this was followed by a discussion of the 
      results. RESULTS: Eight of the 15 criteria presented to the experts were included 
      in the framework: disease severity, unmet needs, comparative efficacy, 
      comparative safety/tolerability, treatment intent, comparative treatment cost, 
      comparative other medical costs, and quality of evidence. Framework validation in 
      2 drug cases resulted in similar value scores, although they were based on 
      different contributing criteria and resulted in different clinical 
      recommendations. CONCLUSION: We developed and validated a reflective MCDA 
      framework for the assessment and positioning of oncologic therapies in Spain. 
      Additional work is needed to create a manual for practical decision making in the 
      clinical setting.

AB  - Due to various desirable physicochemical properties, ionic liquids (ILs) are 
      still gaining in popularity. ILs have been recurrently considered green solvents. 
      However, environmental, health and safety assessments of ILs have raised certain 
      doubts about their benignness, and their greenness status is currently unclear. 
      To clarify the situation on their greenness, we perform a comprehensive 
      assessment of more than 300 commercially available ILs. We apply multicriteria 
      decision analysis, the tool that allows ranking many alternatives according to 
      relevant criteria. They are toxicity towards various organisms, biodegradability, 
      hazard statements and precautionary measures during their handling. We 
      incorporated organic solvents to rankings, as their greenness is better 
      described, so they serve as greenness reference points. The ranking results 
      obtained considering the whole set of criteria show that ILs are placed between 
      recommended polar solvents and problematic/undesirable non polar organic solvents 
      in terms of greenness. However, the exclusion of toxicity data due to 
      unavailability of endpoints results in assessment of ILs as greener than most of 
      organic solvents.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Health administration is complex and serves many masters. Value, 
      quality, infrastructure and reimbursement are just a sample of the competing 
      interests influencing executive decision-making. This creates a need for decision 
      processes that are rational and holistic. METHODS: We created a multicriteria 
      decision analysis tool to evaluate six fields of healthcare provision: return on 
      investment, capacity, outcomes, safety, training and risk. The tool was designed 
      for prospective use, at the beginning of each funding round for competing 
      projects. Administrators were asked to rank their criteria in order of 
      preference. Each field was assigned a representative weight determined from the 
      rankings. Project data were then entered into the tool for each of the six 
      fields. The score for each field was scaled as a proportion of the highest 
      scoring project, then weighted by preference. We then plotted findings on a 
      cost-effectiveness plane. The project was piloted and developed over successive 
      uses by the hospital's executive board. RESULTS: Twelve projects competing for 
      funding at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital were scored by the tool. It 
      created a priority ranking for each initiative based on the weights assigned to 
      each field by the executive board. Projects were plotted on a cost-effectiveness 
      plane with score as the x-axis and cost of implementation as the y-axis. Projects 
      to the bottom right were considered dominant over projects above and to the left, 
      indicating that they provided greater benefit at a lower cost. Projects below the 
      x-axis were cost-saving and recommended provided they did not harm patients. All 
      remaining projects above the x-axis were then recommended in order of lowest to 
      highest cost-per-point scored. CONCLUSION: This tool provides a transparent, 
      objective method of decision analysis using accessible software. It would serve 
      health services delivery organisations that seek to achieve value in healthcare.

TI  - Value-based person-centred integrated care for frail elderly living at home: a 
      quasi-experimental evaluation using multicriteria decision analysis.
PG  - e054672
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-054672 [doi]
LID - e054672
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the value of the person-centred, integrated care programme 
      Care Chain Frail Elderly (CCFE) compared with usual care, using multicriteria 
      decision analysis (MCDA). DESIGN: In a 12-month quasi-experimental study, 
      triple-aim outcomes were measured at 0, 6 and 12 months by trained interviewers 
      during home-visits. SETTING: Primary care, community-based elderly care. 
      PARTICIPANTS: 384 community-dwelling frail elderly were enrolled. The 12-month 
      completion rate was 70% in both groups. Propensity score matching was used to 
      balance age, gender, marital status, living situation, education, smoking status 
      and 3 month costs prior to baseline between the two groups. INTERVENTION: The 
      CCFE is an integrated care programme with unique features like the presence of 
      the elderly and informal caregiver at the multidisciplinary team meetings, and a 
      bundled payment. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES MEASURES: The MCDA results in 
      weighted overall value scores that combines the performance on physical 
      functioning, psychological well-being, social relationships and participation, 
      enjoyment of life, resilience, person-centredness, continuity of care and costs, 
      with importance weights of patients, informal caregivers, professionals, payers 
      and policy-makers. RESULTS: At 6 months, the overall value scores of CCFE were 
      higher in all stakeholder groups, driven by enjoyment of life (standardised 
      performance scores 0.729 vs 0.685) and person-centredness (0.749 vs 0.663). At 12 
      months, the overall value scores in both groups were similar from a patient's 
      perspective, slightly higher for CCFE from an informal caregiver's and 
      professional's perspective, and lower for CCFE from a payer's and policy-maker's 
      perspective. The latter was driven by a worse performance on physical functioning 
      (0.682 vs 0.731) and higher costs (€22 816 vs €20 680). CONCLUSIONS: The MCDA 
      indicated that the CCFE is the preferred way of delivering care to frail elderly 
      at 6 months. However, at 12 months, MCDA results showed little difference from 
      the perspective of patients, informal caregivers and professionals, while payers 
      and policy-makers seemed to prefer usual care.

TI  - Pragmatic Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) Combined With Advanced 
      Pharmacoepidemiology for Benefit-Risk Assessments of Medicines Adapted to the 
      Real-Life Constraints of Regulators: Development and Case Study.
PG  - 620-631
LID - 10.1177/2168479016642812 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) represents a promising method 
      for benefit-risk assessment. Our goal was to develop features of pragmatic MCDA 
      (EVIDEM [Evidence and Value: Impact on DEcisionMaking]) addressing real-life 
      regulatory decision-making needs, incorporate advanced pharmacoepidemiology, and 
      test the resulting benefit-risk framework using a case study. METHODS: The 
      Intervention Outcomes domain of EVIDEM was transformed into a generic 
      benefit-risk framework including clinical efficacy, patient-reported outcomes, 
      and adverse event (AE) criteria. The concept of relative benefit-risk balance 
      (RBRB) was developed for comparability across products and therapeutic areas and 
      over time. Evidence matrix was designed to include most relevant data from 
      trials, observational studies, and models, including Bayesian and longitudinal 
      modeling. The framework was tested with a panel of stakeholders using efalizumab 
      for psoriasis as retrospective case study. Uncertainty was explored. RESULTS: The 
      MCDA benefit-risk tree was adapted with psoriasis-specific subcriteria. Panelists 
      assigned similar weights to benefits (0.48; SD, 0.20-0.70) and risks (0.52; SD, 
      0.10-0.60), with large variations reflecting diverse perspectives. Panelist 
      scores reflected higher efficacy versus placebo, lower efficacy versus active 
      comparators, and serious and fatal AEs identified postlicensing. Efalizumab's 
      RBRB was positive at licensing in 2004 (0.29, scale -1 to +1) and ranged from 
      -0.41 (vs active comparators) to 0.01 (vs placebo) in 2009, when its market 
      authorization was withdrawn. Retesting indicated good reproducibility. Panelists 
      acknowledged good face validity and the importance of criteria beyond 
      benefit-risk in real-life assessments. CONCLUSIONS: The approach allows 
      quantification and visualization of benefit-risk over time and across 
      comparators. Combination of pragmatic MCDA designed to integrate criteria beyond 
      benefit-risk and advanced statistics supports application of MCDA to further 
      accountable benefit-risk assessments for real-life decision making.

TI  - Treacle and Smallpox: Two Tests for Multicriteria Decision Analysis Models in 
      Health Technology Assessment.

AB  - Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is rightly receiving increasing attention 
      in health technology assessment. Nevertheless, a distinguishing feature of the 
      health domain is that technologies must actually improve health, and good 
      performance on other criteria cannot compensate for failure to do so. We argue 
      for two reasonable tests for MCDA models: the treacle test (can a winning 
      intervention be incompletely ineffective?) and the smallpox test (can a winning 
      intervention be for a disease that no one suffers from?). We explore why models 
      might fail such tests (as the models of some existing published studies would do) 
      and offer some suggestions as to how practice should be improved.

AB  - We focus on a class of multicriteria methods that are commonly used in 
      environmental decision making--those that employ the weighted linear average 
      algorithm (and this includes the popular analytic hierarchy process (AHP)). While 
      we do not doubt the potential benefits of using formal decision methods of this 
      type, we draw attention to the consequences of not using them well. In 
      particular, we highlight a property of these methods that should not be 
      overlooked when they are applied in environmental and wider decision-making 
      contexts: the final decision or ranking of options is dependent on the choice of 
      performance scoring scales for the criteria when the criteria weights are held 
      constant. We compare this "sensitivity" to a well-known criticism of the AHP, and 
      we go on to describe the more general lesson when it comes to using weighted 
      linear average methods--a lesson concerning the relationship between criteria 
      weights and performance scoring scales.

TI  - Multicriteria decision analysis for monitoring ecosystem service function of the 
      Three-River Headwaters region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China.
PG  - 355
LID - 10.1007/s10661-015-4523-5 [doi]
AB  - The Three-River Headwaters (TRH) region in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China, is 
      of key importance to the ecological security of China and Southeast Asia and 
      contains some of the most sensitive and fragile ecosystems. Monitoring and 
      evaluating the ecosystem service function and its changes in the TRH region could 
      support decision-making for regional ecological protection and restoration 
      programs. Referencing the concept of ecosystem service and the Millennium 
      Ecosystem Assessment (MA) framework, this study built a system of indicators for 
      monitoring and evaluating the ecosystem service function. Thus, combining a 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) and weighted linear combination (WLC) with 
      analytic hierarchy process (AHP), we applied the ecosystem service function index 
      (ESFI) based on remote sensing data at 1-km spatial resolution to 
      spatiotemporally monitor the changes during the period 2005-2010. The study 
      results indicated that ESFI had a good performance for monitoring the ecosystem 
      service function and showed an improving trend in the TRH region over the past 5 
      years. Ecosystem environment recovery not only reflected the changing trend of 
      warm and wet climate but was also a response of the ecological protection project 
      of the Key Ecological Function Zone in the TRH region.

      Multicriteria decision analysis.
PG  - 109-120
LID - 10.20882/adicciones.1263 [doi]
AB  - The aim of the current study was to establish the most relevant health outcomes 
      to assess opioid substitution treatment programmes (OSP) in patients with opioid 
      use disorder (OUD) in Spain. A multicriteria decision analysis was applied in 3 
      phases: 1) concepts and criteria definitions; 2) criteria screening and weighting 
      by means of a discrete choice experiment; 3) deliberative process. Criteria 
      established in phase 1 were: substance use (opioids, alcohol, tobacco, stimulants 
      and cannabis), other mental disorders (affective/anxiety disorder, psychosis, 
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, borderline personality disorder, 
      antisocial personality disorder, gambling disorder and other impulse control 
      disorders), level of disability, adherence, medical illnesses (medical 
      comorbidities, risk behaviours, infectious and sexually transmitted diseases), 
      psychosocial aspects (hostile and/or violent behaviour and work problems), 
      functional disability (quality of life, treatment and service satisfaction, 
      social functionality). In phase 2, the most relevant factors in OSP were 
      determined, and subsequently assessed in the deliberative process: remission of 
      substance use (opioids, alcohol and stimulants), improvement of other mental 
      disorders (psychosis and borderline personality disorder), improvement in 
      comorbidity management, and improvement in social functionality, with a weighting 
      of 56.5%, 21.9%, 11.0%, and 10.7%, respectively. The current analysis defines the 
      main health outcomes in OSP in patients with OUD in Spain, supporting decision 
      making and socio-health management of existing resources.

TI  - Treatment Preference for Alzheimer's Disease: A Multicriteria Decision Analysis 
      with Caregivers, Neurologists, and Payors.
PG  - 211-227
LID - 10.1007/s40120-022-00423-y [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder 
      associated with a high burden of illness. New therapies under development include 
      agents that target amyloid-beta (Aβ), a key component in AD pathogenesis. 
      Understanding the decision-making process for new AD drugs would help determine 
      if such therapies should be adopted by society. Multicriteria decision analysis 
      (MCDA) was applied to three key stakeholder groups to assess treatment 
      alternatives for AD based on a multitude of decision trade-offs covering main 
      components of care. METHODS: AD caregivers (n = 117), neurologists (n = 90), and 
      payors (n = 90) from the USA received an online survey. The decision problem was 
      broken down into four decision criterion and 12 subcriteria for two treatment 
      scenarios: an Aβ-targeted therapy vs. the standard of care (SOC). Respondents 
      were asked to indicate how much they preferred one option over another on a scale 
      from 1 (equal preference) to 9 (high preference) based on each criterion and 
      subcriterion. The decision criteria and subcriteria were weighted and presented 
      as partial utility scores (pUS), with higher scores suggesting an increased 
      preference for that decision-making component. RESULTS: Caregivers and payors 
      applied the highest value to need for intervention (mean pUS = 0.303 and 0.259) 
      and clinical outcomes (mean pUS = 0.286 and 0.377). In contrast, neurologists 
      placed the highest value on clinical outcomes and types of benefits (mean 
      pUS = 0.436 and 0.248). When decision subcriteria were examined, efficacy (mean 
      pUS = 0.115, 0.219, and 0.166) and the type of patient benefits (mean 
      pUS = 0.135, 0.178, and 0.126) were among the most valued by caregivers, 
      neurologists, and payors. CONCLUSION: All groups placed the highest value on drug 
      efficacy and types of benefit derived by patients. In contrast, cost implications 
      were among the least important aspects in their decision-making.

AB  - A novel and efficient approach to optimization of extraction step prior the 
      chromatographic determination of nine chlorinated phenols is described. It is 
      based on the combination of design of experiments and multicriteria decision 
      analysis. Such an approach is used to optimize dispersive liquid-liquid 
      microextraction procedure for the determination of 9 chlorophenols in water 
      samples. Three parameters are optimized - sample volume, volume of disperser 
      solvent and extraction solvent. Combination of the technique for order of 
      preference by similarity to ideal solution with central composite design allows 
      to perform multi-analyte procedure optimization. It gives information about the 
      efficiency of the system for every experimental plan point in terms of closeness 
      to ideal solution. The optimal conditions for extraction of chlorophenols are 
      76 μL of extraction solvent, 0.6 mL of dispersive solvent and 6.7 mL of water 
      sample. The presented approach has the potential to be applied in variety of 
      optimization systems.

AB  - A rough-interval-based multicriteria decision analysis method (RI-MCDA) is 
      developed for supporting the selection of remediation strategies for 
      1,1-dichloroethane contaminated sites. The concept of ''rough interval'' is 
      introduced in the design framework to represent dual-uncertain parameters. Three 
      rough-interval scenarios generated through pair-wise combining the values under 
      three confidence levels (i.e. 68.3%, 95.4% and 99.7%) and one deterministic 
      scenario adopted crisp numbers for parameters are introduced into the framework. 
      The proposed method is then applied to a contaminated site in the Pudong district 
      of Shanghai, China. Fifty remediation alternatives under four duration options 
      (i.e. 5, 10, 15, and 20 years) and ten criteria, including daily total pumping 
      rate, total cost and rough-interval risk information in light of uncertainty 
      parameter (e.g. slope factor), are taken into consideration to compare different 
      alternatives through RI-MCDA. Results indicated that the most desirable 
      remediation strategy lied in A25 for the 5-year, A10 for the 10-year, A15 for the 
      15-year, and A11 for the 20-year remediation. Compared to the traditional MCDA, 
      the proposed RI-MCDA shows the uniqueness in addressing the interaction between 
      dual intervals of highly uncertain parameters, as well as their joint impact on 
      the decision results, which reduces the subjectivity as much as possible.

TI  - Applying a Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) Approach to Elicit 
      Stakeholders' Preferences in Italy: The Case of Obinutuzumab for 
      Rituximab-Refractory Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (iNHL).
PG  - 153-163
LID - 10.1007/s41669-017-0048-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Healthcare decision makers need to make trade-offs between different 
      elements of value of new treatments. Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) 
      provides a framework that can help decision makers to understand stakeholders' 
      preferences and be explicit about the trade-offs that are being made. OBJECTIVE: 
      The objective of this study was to use MCDA to obtain preferences and views on 
      decision criteria across three stakeholder groups (patients, clinicians and 
      payers) in Italy and to use these to assess the performance of obinutuzumab for 
      rituximab-refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL). METHODS: We used 
      EVIDEM V3.0, an MCDA framework, and collected participants' preferences via an 
      online survey and structured meetings. RESULTS: Patients and clinicians expressed 
      a preference for interventions targeting severe conditions. Payers expressed 
      preference for treatments targeting areas with an unmet need, which are cheaper 
      than the comparator, and with high-quality evidence. Obinutuzumab in combination 
      with bendamustine, compared with bendamustine alone, received high positive 
      scores for the criteria 'disease severity' and 'type of therapeutic benefit' by 
      all three groups, and negative scores on the economic-related criteria, according 
      to all stakeholder groups. CONCLUSIONS: MCDA can be used to elicit the views of 
      different stakeholder groups and has the potential to structure and inform 
      reimbursement decisions.

TI  - Evaluation of COPD Treatments: A Multicriteria Decision Analysis of Aclidinium 
      and Tiotropium in the United States.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Comparisons of the use of aclidinium bromide and tiotropium bromide 
      for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease often concentrate on 
      key end points (exacerbations) at the expense of other benefits and risks. 
      Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) can help overcome this by using 
      stakeholder preferences to combine multiple end points into an overall value 
      estimate. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the use of aclidinium bromide twice daily via 
      Pressair™ (AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, Wilmington, DE) and of tiotropium once 
      daily via HandiHaler(®) (Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ridgefield, 
      CT) from the perspective of patients using MCDA. METHODS: Literature reviews and 
      clinician engagement were used to identify value criteria. Performance of 
      criteria was estimated from a clinical trial and clinician opinion. Scores and 
      swing weights came from six clinicians who, during a 2-day workshop, reflected 
      their patients' preferences. Scenario and sensitivity analyses were used to 
      explore uncertainty in model designs and inputs. RESULTS: Fourteen criteria, 
      covering clinical effectiveness, safety, and convenience of the treatments of 
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, were identified. Exacerbations and device 
      preloading were identified as the most important to patients; the least important 
      was rescue medication use. Tiotropium's higher overall clinical effectiveness 
      score was offset by aclidinium's better performance on safety and convenience 
      outcomes. The MCDA generated a -42 (worst performance) to 100 (best performance) 
      scale. The net impact of benefits over risks of aclidinium (38.5) exceeded that 
      of tiotropium (13.2), and patients preferred aclidinium 79.7% of the time. 
      CONCLUSIONS: When considering clinical benefits and risks, aclidinium and 
      tiotropium generate similar value to patients, but when convenience criteria are 
      considered, aclidinium may be preferred. Further work is required to replicate 
      these results, including eliciting preferences directly from patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Considering rising health expenditure on the one hand and increasing 
      public expectations on the other hand, there is a need for explicit health care 
      rationing to secure public acceptance of coverage decisions of health 
      interventions. The National Health Security Office, the institute managing the 
      Universal Coverage Scheme in Thailand, recently called for more rational, 
      transparent, and fair decisions on the public reimbursement of health 
      interventions. This article describes the application of multicriteria decision 
      analysis (MCDA) to guide the coverage decisions on including health interventions 
      in the Universal Coverage Scheme health benefit package in the period 2009-2010. 
      METHODS: We described the MCDA priority-setting process through participatory 
      observation and evaluated the rational, transparency, and fairness of the 
      priority-setting process against the accountability for reasonableness framework. 
      RESULTS: The MCDA was applied in four steps: 1) 17 interventions were nominated 
      for assessment; 2) nine interventions were selected for further quantitative 
      assessment on the basis of the following criteria: size of population affected by 
      disease, severity of disease, effectiveness of health intervention, variation in 
      practice, economic impact on household expenditure, and equity and social 
      implications; 3) these interventions were then assessed in terms of 
      cost-effectiveness and budget impact; and 4) decision makers qualitatively 
      appraised, deliberated, and reached consensus on which interventions should be 
      adopted in the package. CONCLUSION: This project was carried out in a real-world 
      context and has considerably contributed to the rational, transparent, and fair 
      priority-setting process through the application of MCDA. Although the present 
      project has applied MCDA in the Thai context, MCDA is adaptable to other 
      settings.

TI  - Application of multicriteria decision analysis tools to two contaminated sediment 
      case studies.
PG  - 223-33
AB  - Environmental decision making is becoming increasingly more information intensive 
      and complex. Our previous work shows that multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) 
      tools offer a scientifically sound decision analytical framework for 
      environmental management, in general, and specifically for selecting optimal 
      sediment management alternatives. Integration of MCDA into risk assessment and 
      sediment management may require linkage of different models and software 
      platforms whose results may lead to somewhat different conclusions. This paper 
      illustrates the application of 3 different MCDA methods in 2 case studies 
      involving contaminated sediment management. These case studies are based on real 
      sediment management problems experienced by the US Army Corps of Engineers and 
      other stakeholders in New York/New Jersey Harbor, USA, and the Cocheco River 
      Superfund Site in New Hampshire, USA. Our analysis shows that application of 3 
      different MCDA tools points to similar management solutions no matter which tool 
      is applied. MCDA tools and approaches were constructively used to elicit the 
      strengths and weaknesses of each method when solving the problem.

TI  - Prioritization of livestock transboundary diseases in Belgium using a 
      multicriteria decision analysis tool based on drivers of emergence.
PG  - 344-376
LID - 10.1111/tbed.13356 [doi]
AB  - During the past decade, livestock diseases have (re-)emerged in areas where they 
      had been previously eradicated or never been recorded before. Drivers (i.e. 
      factors of (re-)emergence) have been identified. Livestock diseases spread 
      irrespective of borders, and therefore, reliable methods are required to help 
      decision-makers to identify potential threats and try stopping their 
      (re-)emergence. Ranking methods and multicriteria approaches are cost-effective 
      tools for such purpose and were applied to prioritize a list of selected diseases 
      (N = 29 including 6 zoonoses) based on the opinion of 62 experts in accordance 
      with 50 drivers-related criteria. Diseases appearing in the upper ranking were 
      porcine epidemic diarrhoea, foot-and-mouth disease, low pathogenic avian 
      influenza, African horse sickness and highly pathogenic avian influenza. The tool 
      proposed uses a multicriteria decision analysis approach to prioritize pathogens 
      according to drivers and can be applied to other countries or diseases.

TI  - Diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection in Medicare patients: multicriteria 
      decision analysis.
PG  - 3275-84
LID - 10.1007/s11999-014-3492-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the setting of finite healthcare resources, developing 
      cost-efficient strategies for periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) diagnosis is 
      paramount. The current levels of knowledge allow for PJI diagnostic 
      recommendations based on scientific evidence but do not consider the benefits, 
      opportunities, costs, and risks of the different diagnostic alternatives. 
      QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We determined the best diagnostic strategy for knee and hip 
      PJI in the ambulatory setting for Medicare patients, utilizing benefits, 
      opportunities, costs, and risks evaluation through multicriteria decision 
      analysis (MCDA). METHODS: The PJI diagnostic definition supported by the 
      Musculoskeletal Infection Society was employed for the MCDA. Using a preclinical 
      model, we evaluated three diagnostic strategies that can be conducted in a 
      Medicare patient seen in the outpatient clinical setting complaining of a painful 
      TKA or THA. Strategies were (1) screening with serum markers (erythrocyte 
      sedimentation rate [ESR]/C-reactive protein [CRP]) followed by arthrocentesis in 
      positive cases, (2) immediate arthrocentesis, and (3) serum markers requested 
      simultaneously with arthrocentesis. MCDA was conducted through the analytic 
      hierarchy process, comparing the diagnostic strategies in terms of benefits, 
      opportunities, costs, and risks. RESULTS: Strategy 1 was the best alternative to 
      diagnose knee PJI among Medicare patients (normalized value: 0.490), followed by 
      Strategy 3 (normalized value: 0.403) and then Strategy 2 (normalized value: 
      0.106). The same ranking of alternatives was observed for the hip PJI model 
      (normalized value: 0.487, 0.405, and 0.107, respectively). The sensitivity 
      analysis found this sequence to be robust with respect to benefits, 
      opportunities, and risks. However, if during the decision-making process, cost 
      savings was given a priority of higher than 54%, the ranking for the preferred 
      diagnostic strategy changed. CONCLUSIONS: After considering the benefits, 
      opportunities, costs, and risks of the different available alternatives, our 
      preclinical model supports the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons 
      recommendations regarding the use of serum markers (ESR/CRP) before 
      arthrocentesis as the best diagnostic strategy for PJI among Medicare patients.

TI  - Spatial multicriteria decision analysis of flood risks in aging-dam management in 
      China: a framework and case study.
PG  - 1368-87
LID - 10.3390/ijerph8051368 [doi]
AB  - Approximately 30,000 dams in China are aging and are considered to be high-level 
      risks. Developing a framework for analyzing spatial multicriteria flood risk is 
      crucial to ranking management scenarios for these dams, especially in densely 
      populated areas. Based on the theories of spatial multicriteria decision 
      analysis, this report generalizes a framework consisting of scenario definition, 
      problem structuring, criteria construction, spatial quantification of criteria, 
      criteria weighting, decision rules, sensitivity analyses, and scenario appraisal. 
      The framework is presented in detail by using a case study to rank dam 
      rehabilitation, decommissioning and existing-condition scenarios. The results 
      show that there was a serious inundation, and that a dam rehabilitation scenario 
      could reduce the multicriteria flood risk by 0.25 in the most affected areas; 
      this indicates a mean risk decrease of less than 23%. Although increased risk 
      (<0.20) was found for some residential and commercial buildings, if the dam were 
      to be decommissioned, the mean risk would not be greater than the current 
      existing risk, indicating that the dam rehabilitation scenario had a higher rank 
      for decreasing the flood risk than the decommissioning scenario, but that dam 
      rehabilitation alone might be of little help in abating flood risk. With 
      adjustments and improvement to the specific methods (according to the 
      circumstances and available data) this framework may be applied to other sites.

TI  - Multicriteria decision analysis to assess options for managing contaminated 
      sediments: Application to Southern Busan Harbor, South Korea.
PG  - 61-71
LID - 10.1897/IEAM_2009-032.1 [doi]
AB  - Many years of untreated effluent discharge from residential areas, a shipyard, a 
      marina, and a large fish market resulted in substantial contamination of bottom 
      sediment in Southern Busan Harbor, South Korea. Contaminants in these sediments 
      include heavy metals and organic compounds. Newly introduced regulations for 
      ocean disposal of dredged material in South Korea pose significant challenges, 
      because the previous practice of offshore disposal of contaminated dredged 
      material was no longer possible after August 2008. The South Korean government 
      has mandated that such sediments be assessed in a way that identifies the most 
      appropriate dredged material management alternative, addressing environmental, 
      social, and cost objectives. An approach using multicriteria decision analysis 
      (MCDA) in combination with comparative risk assessment was used as a systematic 
      and transparent framework for prioritizing several dredged sediment management 
      alternatives. We illustrate how MCDA can recognize the multiple goals of 
      contaminated sediment management. Values used in weighting decision criteria were 
      derived from surveys of stakeholders who were sediment management professionals, 
      business owners, or government decision makers. The results of the analysis 
      showed that land reclamation was the preferred alternative among cement-lock, 
      sediment washing, 3 contained aquatic disposal alternatives (one in combination 
      with a hopper dredge), geotextile tubes, solidification, and land reclamation 
      after solidification treatment. Land reclamation was the preferred alternative, 
      which performed well across all MCDA objectives, because of the availability of a 
      near-shore confined disposal facility within a reasonable distance from the 
      dredging area.

TI  - Surgical approaches for cam femoroacetabular impingement: the use of 
      multicriteria decision analysis.
PG  - 2509-16
LID - 10.1007/s11999-013-2934-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, three surgical approaches are available for the treatment 
      of cam femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), namely surgical hip dislocation (SHD), 
      hip arthroscopy (HA), and the miniopen anterior approach of the hip (MO). 
      Although previous systematic reviews have compared these different approaches, an 
      overall assessment of their performance is not available. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We 
      therefore executed a multidimensional structured comparison considering the 
      benefits, opportunities, costs, and risk (BOCR) of the different approaches using 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA). METHODS: A MCDA using analytic 
      hierarchical process (AHP) was conducted to compare SHD, HA, and MO in terms of 
      BOCR on the basis of available evidence, institutional experience, costs, and our 
      understanding of pathophysiology of FAI. A preclinical decision-making model was 
      created for cam FAI to establish the surgical approach that better accomplishes 
      our objectives regarding the surgical treatment. A total score of an 
      alternative's utility and sensitivity analysis was established using commercially 
      available AHP software. RESULTS: The AHP model based on BOCR showed that MO is 
      the best surgical approach for cam FAI (normalized score: 0.38) followed by HA 
      (normalized score: 0.36) and SHD (normalized score: 0.25). The sensitivity 
      analysis showed that HA would turn into the best alternative if the variable 
      risks account for more than 61.8% of the priority during decision-making. In any 
      other decision-making scenario, MO remains as the best alternative. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Using a recognized method for decision-making, this study provides supportive 
      data for the use of MO approach as our preferred surgical approach for cam FAI. 
      The latter is predominantly derived from the lower cost of this approach. Our 
      data may be considered a proxy performance measurement for surgical approaches in 
      cam FAI.

TI  - Assessing the sustainability of advanced materials using multicriteria decision 
      analysis and the triple bottom line.
PG  - 1021-1028
LID - 10.1002/ieam.4205 [doi]
AB  - Although advanced materials (AdMs) are beneficial in many applications, questions 
      remain as to whether they are more or less sustainable than the conventional 
      materials that they may replace. Currently, there is no available tool to provide 
      clarity to these questions. Traditional approaches for evaluating the 
      sustainability of a chemical or material are usually not standardized, and as a 
      result, the metrics used in sustainability measurements are subjective and often 
      vary from assessor to assessor. Additionally, sustainability characterizations 
      resulting from these approaches are typically presented qualitatively and are 
      often vaguely drawn, making it difficult to confidently and transparently 
      conclude that 1 material is more sustainable than another. This paper aims to 
      address these gaps by enabling stakeholders involved in the production, use, or 
      governance of AdMs to assess the sustainability of AdMs in a consistent, 
      objective, and quantitative way using a multicriteria decision analysis 
      (MCDA)-based model. The model proposed herein adapts a triple-bottom-line (TBL) 
      framework from the Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE) and incorporates 
      criteria weights identified through a stakeholder values assessment conducted by 
      surveying AdM practitioners. Results from the stakeholder values assessment show 
      that the perceived importance of the economic component of the TBL varies the 
      most across stakeholders, and that practitioners providing responses from the 
      perspective of a nongovernmental environmental advocacy group or a regulator of 
      AdMs such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency were more likely 
      to score and weigh economic indicators lower and environmental indicators higher 
      compared to when responding from a business owner perspective. The resulting 
      MCDA-based model allows stakeholders to assess the sustainability of an AdM or 
      AdM-enabled product and compare it to product alternatives, predict how other 
      stakeholders might score a product by identifying the extent to which components 
      of the TBL are valued by other stakeholders, and identify which subcriteria 
      contribute most to an improvement in a product's sustainability score. Integr

AB  - The selection of remedial alternatives for mine sites is a complex task because 
      it involves multiple criteria and often with conflicting objectives. However, an 
      existing framework used to select remedial alternatives lacks multicriteria 
      decision analysis (MCDA) aids and does not consider uncertainty in the selection 
      of alternatives. The objective of this paper is to improve the existing framework 
      by introducing deterministic and probabilistic MCDA methods. The Preference 
      Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) methods have 
      been implemented in this study. The MCDA analysis involves processing inputs to 
      the PROMETHEE methods that are identifying the alternatives, defining the 
      criteria, defining the criteria weights using analytical hierarchical process 
      (AHP), defining the probability distribution of criteria weights, and conducting 
      Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS); running the PROMETHEE methods using these inputs; 
      and conducting a sensitivity analysis. A case study was presented to demonstrate 
      the improved framework at a mine site. The results showed that the improved 
      framework provides a reliable way of selecting remedial alternatives as well as 
      quantifying the impact of different criteria on selecting alternatives.

      Development: A Two-Round, Cross-Country, Multicriteria Decision Analysis.
PG  - 830-845
LID - 10.1177/0272989X20940672 [doi]
AB  - Background. The assessment of value along the clinical development of new 
      biopharmaceutical compounds is a challenging task. Complex and uncertain evidence 
      has to be analyzed, considering a multitude of value preferences from different 
      stakeholders. Objective. To investigate the use of multicriteria decision 
      analysis (MCDA) to support decision making during drug development while 
      considering payer and health technology assessment (HTA) value concerns, by 
      applying the Advance Value Framework in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and 
      testing for the consistency of the results. Design. A multiattribute value theory 
      methodology was applied and 2 rounds of decision conferences (DCs) were organized 
      in 3 countries (England, France, and Germany), with the participation of national 
      key experts and stakeholders using the MACBETH questioning protocol and 
      algorithm. A total of 51 health care professionals, patient advocates, and 
      methodologists, including (ex-) committee members or assessors from national HTA 
      bodies, participated in 6 DCs in the study countries. Target Population. NASH 
      patients in fibrosis stages F2 to 3 were considered. Interventions. The value of 
      a hypothetical product profile was assessed against 3 compounds under development 
      using their phase 2 results. Outcome Measures. DC participants' value preferences 
      were elicited involving criteria selection, options scoring, and criteria 
      weighting. Results. Highly consistent valuation rankings were observed in all 
      DCs, always favoring the same compound. Highly consistent rankings of criteria 
      clusters were observed, favoring therapeutic benefit criteria, followed by safety 
      profile and innovation level criteria. Limitations. There was a lack of 
      comparative treatment effects, early evidence on surrogate endpoints was used, 
      and stakeholder representativeness was limited in some DCs. Conclusions. The use 
      of MCDA is promising in supporting early HTA, illustrating high consistency in 
      results across countries and between study rounds.

AB  - This study presents a novel support tool for the optimization and development of 
      analytical methods. The tool is based on multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), 
      namely the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution 
      (TOPSIS), that allows users to rank possible solutions according to their 
      requirements. In this study, we performed rankings of pairs of eight extraction 
      and three dispersive solvents used in DLLME for chlorophenols extraction from 
      water samples. The first ranking involved sensitivity and precision of the method 
      for each of the nine chlorophenols. The tool is a quantitative solution to the 
      common analytical problem that the change of analytical performance results in 
      better performance for some analytes and worse for others. The second ranking 
      included the assessment of the greenness of each pair of solvents, based on 
      toxicological, ecotoxicological and environmental persistence criteria. The third 
      ranking was based on a combination of sensitivity, precision and greenness 
      criteria. Heptane as an extraction solvent and acetone as a dispersive solvent 
      were selected as the most appropriate ones. The TOPSIS tool is a successful, easy 
      to implement, incorporation of green analytical chemistry values to analytical 
      method optimization.

TI  - Prioritizing the Best Potential Regions for Brine Concentration Systems in the 
      USA Using GIS and Multicriteria Decision Analysis.
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.2c05462 [doi]
AB  - We propose a methodology for identifying and prioritizing the best potential 
      locations for brine concentration facilities in the contiguous United States. The 
      methodology uses a geographic information system and multicriteria decision 
      analysis (GIS-MCDA) to prioritize the potential locations for brine concentration 
      facilities based on thermodynamic, economic, environmental, and social criteria. 
      By integrating geospatial data with a computational simulation of a real brine 
      concentration system, an objective weighting method identifies the weights for 13 
      subcriteria associated with the main criteria. When considering multiple 
      dimensions for decision making, brine concentration facilities centered in 
      Florida were consistently selected as the best location, due to the high 
      second-law efficiency, low transportation cost, and high capacity for supplying 
      municipal water needs to nearby populations. For inland locations, Southeast 
      Texas outperforms all other locations for thermodynamic, economic, and 
      environmental priority cases. A sensitivity analysis evaluates the consistency of 
      the results as the priority of a main criterion varies relative to other 
      decision-making criteria. Focusing on a single subcriterion misleads decision 
      making when identifying the best location for brine concentration systems, 
      identifying the importance of the multicriteria methodology.

TI  - Field testing of a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework for coverage 
      of a screening test for cervical cancer in South Africa.
PG  - 2
LID - 10.1186/1478-7547-10-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systematic and transparent approaches to priority setting are needed, 
      particularly in low-resource settings, to produce decisions that are sound and 
      acceptable to stakeholders. The EVIDEM framework brings together Health 
      Technology Assessment (HTA) and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) by 
      proposing a comprehensive set of decision criteria together with standardized 
      processes to support decisionmaking. The objective of the study was to field test 
      the framework for decisionmaking on a screening test by a private health plan in 
      South Africa. METHODS: Liquid-based cytology (LBC) for cervical cancer screening 
      was selected by the health plan for this field test. An HTA report structured by 
      decision criterion (14 criteria organized in the MCDA matrix and 4 contextual 
      criteria) was produced based on a literature review and input from the health 
      plan. During workshop sessions, committee members 1) weighted each MCDA decision 
      criterion to express their individual perspectives, and 2) to appraise LBC, 
      assigned scores to each MCDA criterion on the basis of the by-criterion HTA 
      report.Committee members then considered the potential impacts of four contextual 
      criteria on the use of LBC in the context of their health plan. Feedback on the 
      framework and process was collected through discussion and from a questionnaire. 
      RESULTS: For 9 of the MCDA matrix decision criteria, 89% or more of committee 
      members thought they should always be considered in decisionmaking. Greatest 
      weights were given to the criteria "Budget impact", "Cost-effectiveness" and 
      "Completeness and consistency of reporting evidence". When appraising LBC for 
      cervical cancer screening, the committee assigned the highest scores to 
      "Relevance and validity of evidence" and "Disease severity". Combination of 
      weights and scores yielded a mean MCDA value estimate of 46% (SD 7%) of the 
      potential maximum value. Overall, the committee felt the framework brought 
      greater clarity to the decisionmaking process and was easily adaptable to 
      different types of health interventions. CONCLUSIONS: The EVIDEM framework was 
      easily adapted to evaluating a screening technology in South Africa, thereby 
      broadening its applicability in healthcare decision making.

AB  - Weight of evidence (WOE) methods are key components of ecological and human 
      health risk assessments. Most WOE applications rely on the qualitative 
      integration of diverse lines of evidence (LOE) representing impact on ecological 
      receptors and humans. Recent calls for transparency in assessments and 
      justifiability of management decisions are pushing the community to consider 
      quantitative methods for integrated risk assessment and management. This article 
      compares and contrasts the type of information required for application of 
      individual WOE techniques and the outcomes that they provide in ecological risk 
      assessment and proposes a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework for 
      integrating individual LOE in support of management decisions. The use of 
      quantitative WOE techniques is illustrated for a hypothetical but realistic case 
      study of selecting remedial alternatives at a contaminated aquatic site. Use of 
      formal MCDA does not necessarily eliminate biases and judgment calls necessary 
      for selecting remedial alternatives, but allows for transparent evaluation and 
      fusion of individual LOE. It also provides justifiable methods for selecting 
      remedial alternatives consistent with stakeholder and decision-maker values.

      persons with tetraplegia.
PG  - 635-44
AB  - This study supported the evaluation by a rehabilitation team of the performance 
      of two treatment options that improve the arm-hand function in subjects with 
      sixth cervical vertebra (C6) level Motor Group 2 tetraplegia. The analytic 
      hierarchy process, a technique for multicriteria decision analysis, was used by a 
      rehabilitation team and potential recipients to quantitatively compare a new 
      technology, Functional Elec trical Stimulation (FES), with conventional surgery. 
      Perform-ance was measured by functional improvement, treatment load, risks, 
      user-friendliness, and social outcomes. Functional improvement after FES was 
      considered better than that after conventional surgery. However, the 
      rehabilitation team's overall rating for conventional surgery was slightly higher 
      than that for FES (57% vs 44%). Compared with the rehabilitation team, potential 
      recipients gave greater weight to burden of treatment and less weight to 
      functional improvement. This study shows that evaluation of new technology must 
      be more comprehensive than the evaluation of functional improvement alone, and 
      that patient preferences may differ from those of the rehabilitation team.

TI  - An assessment of site suitability for marina construction in Istanbul, Turkey, 
      using GIS and AHP multicriteria decision analysis.
PG  - 677
AB  - Marinas play a key role in sea transportation and tourism. The problem of an 
      insufficient marina capacity has revealed in terms of sea traffic due to the 
      demographic structure and increasing tourism potential of Istanbul which is the 
      biggest metropolitan city of Turkey and has around 600-km-long coastline. 
      Therefore, the study area is mainly focused on the Marmara Sea shoreline of 
      Istanbul. Rather than traditional methods, a rapid and cost-effective solution 
      which considers natural and urban environment conditions is essential to satisfy 
      the need for a marina site selection. Thanks to the latest improvements in 
      geographic information systems, it is convenient to perform location selection 
      analysis of marinas taking advantages of geology, land use, demography and 
      accessibility data sets. The goal of this study is to define the areas that are 
      appropriate for building marinas, with the use of topographic and demographic 
      data in a present shoreline applying analytical hierarchy process multicriteria 
      decision-making method. In this study, erosion, landslide, tsunami, land use, 
      geologically hazardous areas, transfer lines, sea traffic data, neighbourhood 
      scale population, age patterns and house income data have been used. Analytical 
      hierarchy process method is used to give a weight to each data set, and a grading 
      system has been developed for the area selection of marinas. The result maps of 
      the analysis that show study area as classified into four categories from good to 
      not suitable are presented. It is possible to create a decision support system 
      for upper scale plans that enable authorities to perform analysis accurately, 
      cost and time effectively using the proposed methodology that integrates multiple 
      data sets with different scales and types.

TI  - Health care priority setting in Norway a multicriteria decision analysis.
PG  - 39
LID - 10.1186/1472-6963-12-39 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Priority setting in population health is increasingly based on 
      explicitly formulated values. The Patients Rights Act of the Norwegian tax-based 
      health service guaranties all citizens health care in case of a severe illness, a 
      proven health benefit, and proportionality between need and treatment. This study 
      compares the values of the country's health policy makers with these three 
      official principles. METHODS: In total 34 policy makers participated in a 
      discrete choice experiment, weighting the relative value of six policy criteria. 
      We used multi-variate logistic regression with selection as dependent valuable to 
      derive odds ratios for each criterion. Next, we constructed a composite league 
      table - based on the sum score for the probability of selection - to rank 
      potential interventions in five major disease areas. RESULTS: The group 
      considered cost effectiveness, large individual benefits and severity of disease 
      as the most important criteria in decision making. Priority interventions are 
      those related to cardiovascular diseases and respiratory diseases. Less 
      attractive interventions rank those related to mental health. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Norwegian policy makers' values are in agreement with principles formulated in 
      national health laws. Multi-criteria decision approaches may provide a tool to 
      support explicit allocation decisions.

TI  - From "weight of evidence" to quantitative data integration using multicriteria 
      decision analysis and Bayesian methods.
PG  - 3-8
LID - 10.14573/altex.1412231 [doi]
AB  - "Weighing" available evidence in the process of decision-making is unavoidable, 
      yet it is one step that routinely raises suspicions: what evidence should be 
      used, how much does it weigh, and whose thumb may be tipping the scales? This 
      commentary aims to evaluate the current state and future roles of various types 
      of evidence for hazard assessment as it applies to environmental health. In its 
      recent evaluation of the US Environmental Protection Agency's Integrated Risk 
      Information System assessment process, the National Research Council committee 
      singled out the term "weight of evidence" (WoE) for critique, deeming the process 
      too vague and detractive to the practice of evaluating human health risks of 
      chemicals. Moving the methodology away from qualitative, vague and controversial 
      methods towards generalizable, quantitative and transparent methods for 
      appropriately managing diverse lines of evidence is paramount for both regulatory 
      and public acceptance of the hazard assessments. The choice of terminology 
      notwithstanding, a number of recent Bayesian WoE-based methods, the emergence of 
      multi criteria decision analysis for WoE applications, as well as the general 
      principles behind the foundational concepts of WoE, show promise in how to move 
      forward and regain trust in the data integration step of the assessments. We 
      offer our thoughts on the current state of WoE as a whole and while we 
      acknowledge that many WoE applications have been largely qualitative and 
      subjective in nature, we see this as an opportunity to turn WoE towards a 
      quantitative direction that includes Bayesian and multi criteria decision 
      analysis.

TI  - Assessment of irrigation water quality by a Geographic Information 
      System-Multicriteria Decision Analysis-based model: A case study from Ankara, 
      Turkey.
PG  - 1420-1432
LID - 10.1002/wer.1133 [doi]
AB  - In this study, the irrigation water quality of Eryaman region in Ankara (Turkey) 
      has been investigated using a Geographic Information System-Multicriteria 
      Decision Analysis (GIS-MCDA)-based model. Two different irrigation water quality 
      indices (IWQI-A and IWQI-B) based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Data 
      Envelopment Analysis (DEA) have been developed to provide a single suitability 
      score for all criteria of irrigation water quality. The irrigation water quality 
      indices were composed of 3 main criteria and 11 sub-criteria. Based on irrigation 
      water quality indices, four suitability classes have been identified as (a) 
      excellent, (b) good, (c) permissible, and (d) unsuitable. Irrigation water 
      quality maps were created by using kriging method and the water quality index 
      scores. The temporal variation of irrigation water quality was evaluated using 
      the models created for July 2007, 2010, and 2015 years. The most suitable areas 
      for irrigation water are concentrated in the eastern and western parts of the 
      region where the IWQI-B scores were >0.85. In recent years, the deterioration in 
      irrigation water quality has increased in the southern parts of the basin. This 
      research has demonstrated that the indices created by using DEA and AHP methods 
      are reliable indicators to assess irrigation water quality. PRACTITIONER POINTS: 
      Water quality indices can be used to depict the overall water quality status in 
      water management planning. To avoid problems when modeling groundwater quality, 
      the factors that have the most effect on water quality should be selected. 
      Analytic Hierarchy Process and Data Envelopment Analysis techniques are efficient 
      and reliable methods to determine water quality.

TI  - Application of multicriteria decision analysis to jar-test results for chemicals 
      selection in the physical-chemical treatment of textile wastewater.
PG  - 288-95
LID - 10.1016/j.jhazmat.2008.08.046 [doi]
AB  - Jar-test is a well-known tool for chemicals selection for physical-chemical 
      wastewater treatment. Jar-test results show the treatment efficiency in terms of 
      suspended matter and organic matter removal. However, in spite of having all 
      these results, coagulant selection is not an easy task because one coagulant can 
      remove efficiently the suspended solids but at the same time increase the 
      conductivity or increase considerably the sludge production containing chemicals 
      and toxic dyes. This makes the final selection of coagulants very dependent on 
      the relative importance assigned to each measured parameter. In this paper, the 
      use of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is proposed to help on the 
      selection of the coagulant and its concentration in the physical-chemical 
      wastewater treatment, since textile wastewater contains hazardous substances. 
      Therefore, starting from the parameters fixed by the jar-test results, these 
      techniques will allow to weight these parameters, according to the judgements of 
      wastewater experts, and to establish priorities among coagulants. Two well-known 
      MCDA techniques have been used: analytic hierarchic process (AHP) and preference 
      ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEEs) and their 
      results were compared. The method proposed has been applied to the particular 
      case of textile wastewaters. The results obtained show that MCDA techniques are 
      useful tools to select the chemicals for the physical-technical treatment.

TI  - Bridging health technology assessment (HTA) and efficient health care decision 
      making with multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA): applying the EVIDEM framework 
      to medicines appraisal.
PG  - 376-88
LID - 10.1177/0272989X11416870 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health care decision making is complex and requires efficient and 
      explicit processes to ensure transparency and consistency of factors considered. 
      OBJECTIVES: To pilot an adaptable decision-making framework incorporating 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) in health technology assessment (HTA) with 
      a pan-Canadian group of policy and clinical decision makers and researchers 
      appraising 10 medicines covering 6 therapeutic areas. METHODS: An appraisal group 
      was convened and participants were asked to express their individual 
      perspectives, independently of the medicines, by assigning weights to each 
      criterion of the MCDA core model: disease severity, size of population, current 
      practice and unmet needs, intervention outcomes (efficacy, safety, patient 
      reported), type of health benefit, economics, and quality of evidence. 
      Participants then assigned performance scores for each medicine using available 
      evidence synthesized in a "by-criterion" HTA report covering each of the MCDA 
      CORE model criteria. MCDA estimates of perceived value were calculated by 
      combining normalized weights and scores. Feedback on the approach was collected 
      through structured discussion. RESULTS: Relative weights on criteria varied 
      widely, reflecting the diverse perspectives of participants. Scores for each 
      criterion provided a performance measure, highlighting strengths and weaknesses 
      of each medicine. MCDA estimates of perceived value ranged from 0.42 to 0.64 
      across medicines, providing comprehensive measures incorporating a large spectrum 
      of criteria. Participants reported that the framework provided an efficient 
      approach to systematic consideration in a pragmatic format of the multiple 
      elements guiding decision, including criteria and values (MCDA core model) and 
      evidence (HTA "by-criterion" report). CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept study 
      demonstrated the usefulness of incorporating MCDA in HTA to support transparent 
      and systematic appraisal of health care interventions. Further research is needed 
      to advance MCDA-based approaches to more effective healthcare decision making.

TI  - Risk Mapping of Influenza D Virus Occurrence in Ruminants and Swine in Togo Using 
      a Spatial Multicriteria Decision Analysis Approach.
LID - 10.3390/v12020128 [doi]
LID - 128
AB  - Influenza D virus (IDV) has been identified in several continents, with 
      serological evidence for the virus in Africa. In order to improve the sensitivity 
      and cost-benefit of IDV surveillance in Togo, risk maps were drawn using a 
      spatial multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) and experts' opinion to evaluate 
      the relevance of sampling areas used so far. Areas at highest risk of IDV 
      occurrence were the main cattle markets. The maps were evaluated with previous 
      field surveillance data collected in Togo between 2017 and 2019: 1216 sera from 
      cattle, small ruminants, and swine were screened for antibodies to IDV by 
      hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays. While further samples collections are 
      needed to validate the maps, the risk maps resulting from the spatial MCDA 
      approach generated here highlight several priority areas for IDV circulation 
      assessment.

TI  - Modelling habitat suitability in Jordan for the cutaneous leishmaniasis vector 
      (Phlebotomus papatasi) using multicriteria decision analysis.
PG  - e0008852
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0008852 [doi]
LID - e0008852
AB  - Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a zoonotic vector-borne neglected tropical 
      disease transmitted by female Phlebotomine sand flies. It is distributed globally 
      but a large proportion of cases (70-75%) are found in just ten countries. CL is 
      endemic in Jordan yet there is a lack of robust entomological data and true 
      reporting status is unknown. This study aimed to map habitat suitability of the 
      main CL vector, Phlebotomus papatasi, in Jordan as a proxy for CL risk 
      distribution to (i) identify areas potentially at risk of CL and (ii) estimate 
      the human population at risk of CL. A literature review identified potential 
      environmental determinants for P. papatasi occurrence including temperature, 
      humidity, precipitation, vegetation, wind speed, presence of human households and 
      presence of the fat sand rat. Each predictor variable was (a) mapped; (b) 
      standardized to a common size, resolution and scale using fuzzy membership 
      functions; (c) assigned a weight using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP); 
      and (d) included within a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to produce 
      monthly maps illustrating the predicted habitat suitability (between 0 and 1) for 
      P. papatasi in Jordan. Suitability increased over the summer months and was 
      generally highest in the north-western regions of the country and along the 
      Jordan Valley, areas which largely coincided with highly populated parts of the 
      country, including areas where Syrian refugee camps are located. Habitat 
      suitability in Jordan for the main CL vector-P. papatasi-was heterogeneous over 
      both space and time. Suitable areas for P. papatasi coincided with highly 
      populated areas of Jordan which suggests that the targeted implementation of 
      control and surveillance strategies in defined areas such as those with very high 
      CL vector suitability (>0.9 suitability) would focus only on 3.42% of the 
      country's total geographic area, whilst still including a substantial proportion 
      of the population at risk: estimates range from 72% (European Commission's Global 
      Human Settlement population grid) to 89% (Gridded Population of the World) 
      depending on the human population density data used. Therefore, high impact 
      public health interventions could be achieved within a reduced spatial target, 
      thus maximizing the efficient use of resources.

TI  - A benefit-risk assessment model for statins using multicriteria decision analysis 
      based on a discrete choice experiment in Korean patients.
PG  - 965-74
LID - 10.2147/TCRM.S100438 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The benefit-risk balance for drugs can alter post approval owing to 
      additional data on efficacy or adverse events. This study developed a 
      quantitative benefit-risk assessment (BRA) model for statins using multicriteria 
      decision analysis with discrete choice experiments and compared a recent BRA with 
      that at the time of approval. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Following a systematic review 
      of the literature, the benefit criteria within the statin BRA model were defined 
      as a reduction in the plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and a 
      reduction in myocardial infarction incidence; the risk criteria were 
      hepatotoxicity (Liv) and fatal rhabdomyolysis (Rha). The scores for these 
      criteria were estimated using mixed treatment comparison methods. Weighting was 
      calculated from a discrete choice experiment involving 203 Korean patients. The 
      scores and weights were integrated to produce an overall value representing the 
      benefit-risk balance, and sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: In this 
      BRA model, low-density lipoprotein (relative importance [RI]: 37.50%) was found 
      to be a more important benefit criterion than myocardial infarction (RI: 35.43%), 
      and Liv (RI: 16.28%) was a more important risk criterion than Rha (RI: 10.79%). 
      Patients preferred atorvastatin, and the preference ranking of cerivastatin and 
      simvastatin was switched post approval because of the emergence of additional 
      risk information related to cerivastatin. CONCLUSION: A quantitative statin BRA 
      model confirmed that the preference ranking of statins changed post approval 
      because of the identification of additional benefits or risks.

TI  - A quantitative benefit-risk assessment approach to improve decision making in 
      drug development: Application of a multicriteria decision analysis model in the 
      development of combination therapy for overactive bladder.
PG  - 442-51
LID - 10.1002/cpt.271 [doi]
AB  - A multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach was developed and used to 
      estimate the benefit-risk of solifenacin and mirabegron and their combination in 
      the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB). The objectives were 1) to develop an 
      MCDA tool to compare drug effects in OAB quantitatively, 2) to establish 
      transparency in the evaluation of the benefit-risk profile of various dose 
      combinations, and 3) to quantify the added value of combination use compared to 
      monotherapies. The MCDA model was developed using efficacy, safety, and 
      tolerability attributes and the results of a phase II factorial design 
      combination study were evaluated. Combinations of solifenacin 5 mg and mirabegron 
      25 mg and mirabegron 50 (5+25 and 5+50) scored the highest clinical utility and 
      supported combination therapy development of solifenacin and mirabegron for phase 
      III clinical development at these dose regimens. This case study underlines the 
      benefit of using a quantitative approach in clinical drug development programs.

TI  - Balancing equity and efficiency in health priorities in Ghana: the use of 
      multicriteria decision analysis.
PG  - 1081-7
LID - 10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00392.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To guide the Ministry of Health in Ghana in the priority setting of 
      interventions by quantifying the trade-off between equity, efficiency, and other 
      societal concerns in health. METHODS: The study applied a multicriteria decision 
      analytical framework. A focus group of seven policymakers identified the relevant 
      criteria for priority setting and 63 policymakers participated in a discrete 
      choice experiment to weigh their relative importance. Regression analysis was 
      used to rank order a set of health interventions on the basis of these criteria 
      and associated weights. RESULTS: Policymakers in Ghana consider targeting of 
      vulnerable populations and cost-effectiveness as the most important criteria for 
      priority setting of interventions, followed by severity of disease, number of 
      beneficiaries, and diseases of the poor. This translates into a general 
      preference for interventions in child health, reproductive health, and 
      communicable diseases. CONCLUSION: Study results correspond with the overall 
      vision of the Ministry of Health in Ghana, and are instrumental in the assessment 
      of present and future investments in health. Multicriteria decision analysis 
      contributes to transparency and accountability in policymaking.

TI  - Feasibility of Measuring Preferences for Chemotherapy Among Early-Stage Breast 
      Cancer Survivors Using a Direct Rank Ordering Multicriteria Decision Analysis 
      Versus a Time Trade-Off.
PG  - 557-566
LID - 10.1007/s40271-020-00423-w [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Chemotherapy is increasingly a preference-based choice among women 
      diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) 
      is a promising but underutilized method to facilitate shared decision making. We 
      explored the feasibility of conducting an MCDA using direct rank ordering versus 
      a time trade-off (TTO) to assess chemotherapy choice in a large population-based 
      sample. METHODS: We surveyed 904 early-stage breast cancer survivors who were 
      within 5 years of diagnosis and reported to the Western Washington State Cancer 
      System and Kaiser Permanente Northern California registries. Direct rank ordering 
      of 11 criteria and TTO surveys were conducted from September 2015 to July 2016; 
      clinical data were obtained from registries or medical records. Multivariable 
      regressions estimated post hoc associations between the MCDA, TTO, and 
      self-reported chemotherapy receipt, considering covariates. RESULTS: Survivors 
      ranged in age from 25 to 74 years and 73.9% had stage I tumors. The response rate 
      for the rank ordering was 81.0%; TTO score was 94.2%. A one-standard deviation 
      increase in the difference between the chemotherapy and no chemotherapy MCDA 
      scores was associated with a 75.1% (95% confidence interval 43.9-109.7%; 
      p < 0.001) increase in the adjusted odds of having received chemotherapy; no 
      association was found between the TTO score and chemotherapy receipt. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A rank-order-based MCDA was feasible and was associated with 
      chemotherapy choice. Future research should consider developing and testing this 
      MCDA for use in clinical encounters. Additional research is required to develop a 
      TTO-based model and test its properties against a pragmatic MCDA to inform future 
      shared decision-making tools.

TI  - Multicriteria decision analysis for determining drug therapy for intermittent 
      claudication.
PG  - 425-31
AB  - Drugs of various classes are prescribed for intermittent claudication. However, 
      there is some discrepancy between medical practice and the scientific basis for 
      drug selection. We have developed a quantitative criteria-based decision analysis 
      to evaluate all implications of drug treatment choices for intermittent 
      claudication. Pentoxifylline, buflomedil, naftidrofuryl and ticlopidine were the 
      drugs selected for analysis. The evaluation criteria were 1) therapeutic 
      efficacy, 2) safety, 3) patient acceptance and 4) cost. A review panel of experts 
      determined the relative importance of each criterion by assigning points (or 
      utility values) to each one. The points were 48, 20, 14 and 18, respectively, for 
      criteria 1, 2, 3 and 4. A probability value, or numerical estimate of how well a 
      drug meets a criterion, was assigned to each drug for each of the 4 criteria. The 
      probability value was multiplied by the utility value to determine the score for 
      each drug and criterion. The criteria points for each drug were added for a total 
      score for the drug. The drug with the highest overall score was pentoxifylline, 
      with 69 points out of an ideal score of 100. The rank order for the other drugs 
      was buflomedil, ticlopidine and naftidrofuryl. A sensitive analysis showed that 
      the relative ranking of the drugs remained unchanged over a series of data 
      modifications.

TI  - Benefit, risk and cost of new oral anticoagulants and warfarin in atrial 
      fibrillation; A multicriteria decision analysis.
PG  - e0196361
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0196361 [doi]
LID - e0196361
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Warfarin and new oral anticoagulants are effective in reducing 
      stroke in atrial fibrillation; however, the benefits and risks rates in clinical 
      trials show heterogeneity for each anticoagulant, and is unknown the cost 
      influence on a model considering most of the treatment consequences. We designed 
      a benefit-risk and cost assessment of oral anticoagulants. DESIGN: We followed 
      the roadmap proposed by IMI-PROTECT and the considerations of emerged good 
      practice to perform Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). The roadmap defines 
      the following steps: (1) planning, (2) evidence gathering and data preparation, 
      (3) analyses, (4) explorations, and (5) conclusions. We defined two reference 
      points (0-100) to allocate numerical values for scores and weights, and used an 
      analogue numeric scale to assess physicians' preferences. As benefits of the 
      anticoagulant therapy, we included reductions in stroke and all-cause mortality; 
      intracranial haemorrhage, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, minor bleeding and 
      myocardial infarction were considered risks. We also made an estimation of the 
      annual drug cost per person. MAIN RESULTS: The scores were: Apixaban 33, 
      Dabigatrán 25, warfarin 18 and Rivaroxaban 14 this score reveals the most 
      preferred up to the less preferred option, considering the benefit-risk ratio and 
      drug costs altogether. The relative model weights were: 51.1% for risks, 40.4% 
      for benefits and 8.5% for cost. The sensitivity analysis confirms the model 
      robustness. CONCLUSIONS: From this analysis, apixaban should be considered as the 
      preferred anticoagulant option -due to a better benefit-risk balance and a minor 
      cost influence- followed by dabigatran, warfarin and rivaroxaban.

TI  - Regional risk assessment for contaminated sites part 1: vulnerability assessment 
      by multicriteria decision analysis.
PG  - 1295-306
LID - 10.1016/j.envint.2011.05.005 [doi]
AB  - As highlighted in the EU Soil Communication, local contamination is one of the 
      main soil threats and it is often related to present and past industrial 
      activities which left a legacy of a high number of contaminated sites in Europe. 
      These contaminated sites can be harmful to many different receptors according to 
      their sensitivity/susceptibility to contamination, and specific vulnerability 
      evaluations are needed in order to manage this widely spread environmental issue. 
      In this paper a novel comprehensive vulnerability assessment framework to assess 
      regional receptor susceptibility to contaminated site is presented. The developed 
      methodology, which combines multi criteria decision analysis (MCDA) techniques 
      and spatial analysis, can be applied to different receptors recognized as 
      relevant for regional assessment. In order to characterize each receptor, picked 
      parameters significant for the estimation of the vulnerability to contaminated 
      sites have been selected, normalized and aggregated by means of multi criteria 
      decision analysis (MCDA) techniques. The developed MCDA methodology, based on the 
      Choquet integral, allows to include expert judgments for the elicitation of 
      synergic and conflicting effects between involved criteria and is applied to all 
      the geographical objects representing the identified receptors. To test the 
      potential of the vulnerability methodology, it has been applied to a specific 
      case study area in the upper Silesia region of Poland where it proved to be 
      reliable and consistent with the environmental experts' expected results. The 
      vulnerability assessment results indicate that groundwater is the most vulnerable 
      receptor characterized by a wide area with vulnerability scores belonging to the 
      highest vulnerability class. As far as the other receptors are concerned, human 
      health and surface water are characterized by quite homogeneous vulnerability 
      scores falling in the medium-high vulnerability classes, while protected areas 
      resulted to be the less vulnerable receptor with only one protected area falling 
      in the medium vulnerability class. The vulnerability assessment results will 
      support the regional risk assessment for the ranking of potentially contaminated 
      sites at regional scale.

AB  - Landslides are geomorphological phenomena that affect anthropogenic and natural 
      features on the Earth's surface. Many previous studies have identified several 
      factors that have contributed to landslides. Among these factors are physical 
      characteristics, such as slope, aspect, and land cover, of Earth's surface. 
      Moreover, landslides can be triggered by human activities such as underground 
      mining. This study aims to identify landslide susceptibility areas by analyzing 
      landslide-related factors, including land subsidence triggered by underground 
      mining. The area of interest was Kozlu, Turkey, where underground mining has been 
      in progress for the past 100 years. Thus, to identify landslide risk zones, the 
      multicriteria decision analysis method, together with the analytical hierarchy 
      method, was used. The datasets included were topography, land cover, geological 
      settings, and mining-induced land subsidence. The spatial extent of land 
      subsidence was estimated using a previously published model. A landslide 
      susceptibility map (LSM) was developed using a purposely developed GIS-based 
      software. The results were compared with a terrain deformation map, which was 
      developed in a separate study using the differential synthetic aperture radar 
      interferometry (DInSAR) technique. The results showed a substantial correlation 
      between the LSM and DInSAR map. Furthermore, it was found that ~ 88% of the very 
      high and high landslide risk areas coincided with location of the past landslide 
      events. These facts suggest that the algorithm and data sources used were 
      sufficient to produce a sufficiently accurate LSM, which may be used for various 
      purposes such as urban planning.

AB  - The conventional multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods used for 
      pollution control generally depend on the data currently available. This could 
      limit their real-world applications, especially where the input data (e.g., the 
      most cost-effective remediation cost and eventual contaminant concentration) 
      might vary by scenario. This study proposes an optimization-based MCDA (OMCDA) 
      framework to address such a challenge. It is capable of (1) capturing various 
      preferences of decision-makers, (2) screening and analyzing the performance of 
      various optimized remediation strategies under changeable scenarios, and (3) 
      compromising incongruous decision analysis results. A real-world case study is 
      employed for demonstration, where four scenarios are considered with each one 
      corresponding to a set of weights representative of the preference of the 
      decision-makers. Four criteria are selected, i.e., optimal total pumping rate, 
      remediation cost, contaminant concentration, and fitting error. Their values are 
      determined through running optimization and optimization-based simulation 
      procedures. Four sets of the most desired groundwater remediation strategies are 
      identified, implying specific pumping rates under varied scenarios. Results 
      indicate that the best action lies in groups 32 and 16 for the 5-year, groups 49 
      and 36 for the 10-year, groups 26 and 13 for the 15-year, and groups 47 and 13 
      for the 20-year remediation.

AB  - Risk maps are one of several sources used to inform risk-based disease 
      surveillance and control systems, but their production can be hampered by lack of 
      access to suitable disease data. In such situations, knowledge-driven spatial 
      modeling methods are an alternative to data-driven approaches. This study used 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) to identify areas in Asia suitable for the 
      occurrence of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 in domestic 
      poultry. Areas most suitable for H5N1 occurrence included Bangladesh, the 
      southern tip and eastern coast of Vietnam, parts of north-central Thailand and 
      large parts of eastern China. The predictive accuracy of the final model, as 
      determined by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC 
      AUC), was 0.670 (95% CI 0.667-0.673) suggesting that, in data-scarce 
      environments, MCDA provides a reasonable alternative to the data-driven 
      approaches usually used to inform risk-based disease surveillance and control 
      strategies.

TI  - Collaborative environmental planning in river management: an application of 
      multicriteria decision analysis in the White River Watershed in Vermont.
PG  - 534-46
AB  - Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) provides a well-established family of 
      decision tools to aid stakeholder groups in arriving at collective decisions. 
      MCDA can also function as a framework for the social learning process, serving as 
      an educational aid in decision problems characterized by a high level of public 
      participation. In this paper, the framework and results of a structured decision 
      process using the outranking MCDA methodology preference ranking organization 
      method of enrichment evaluation (PROMETHEE) are presented. PROMETHEE is used to 
      frame multi-stakeholder discussions of river management alternatives for the 
      Upper White River of Central Vermont, in the northeastern United States. 
      Stakeholders met over 10 months to create a shared vision of an ideal river and 
      its services to communities, develop a list of criteria by which to evaluate 
      river management alternatives, and elicit preferences to rank and compare 
      individual and group preferences. The MCDA procedure helped to frame a group 
      process that made stakeholder preferences explicit and substantive discussions 
      about long-term river management possible.

TI  - Automated ischemic beat classification using genetic algorithms and multicriteria 
      decision analysis.
PG  - 1717-25
AB  - Cardiac beat classification is a key process in the detection of myocardial 
      ischemic episodes in the electrocardiographic signal. In the present study, we 
      propose a multicriteria sorting method for classifying the cardiac beats as 
      ischemic or not. Through a supervised learning procedure, each beat is compared 
      to preclassified category prototypes under five criteria. These criteria refer to 
      ST segment changes, T wave alterations, and the patient's age. The difficulty in 
      applying the above criteria is the determination of the required method 
      parameters, namely the thresholds and weight values. To overcome this problem, we 
      employed a genetic algorithm, which, after proper training, automatically 
      calculates the optimum values for the above parameters. A task-specific cardiac 
      beat database was developed for training and testing the proposed method using 
      data from the European Society of Cardiology ST-T database. Various experimental 
      tests were carried out in order to adjust each module of the classification 
      system. The obtained performance was 91% in terms of both sensitivity and 
      specificity and compares favorably to other beat classification approaches 
      proposed in the literature.

TI  - Choosing a sustainable demolition waste management strategy using multicriteria 
      decision analysis.
PG  - 12-20
LID - 10.1016/j.wasman.2008.04.010 [doi]
AB  - This paper presents an application of the ELECTRE III decision-aid method in the 
      context of choosing a sustainable demolition waste management strategy for a case 
      study in the city of Lyon, France. This choice of waste management strategy takes 
      into consideration the sustainable development objectives, i.e. economic aspects, 
      environmental consequences, and social issues. Nine alternatives for demolition 
      waste management were compared with the aid of eight criteria, taking into 
      account energy consumption, depletion of abiotic resources, global warming, 
      dispersion of dangerous substances in the environment, economic activity, 
      employment, and quality of life of the local population. The case study concerned 
      the demolition of 25 buildings of an old military camp. Each alternative was 
      illustrated with different waste treatments, such as material recovery, 
      recycling, landfilling, and energy recovery. The recommended solution for 
      sustainable demolition waste management for the case study is a selective 
      deconstruction of each building with local material recovery in road engineering 
      of inert wastes, local energy recovery of wood wastes, and specific treatments 
      for hazardous wastes.

TI  - Charting a path for innovative toilet technology using multicriteria decision 
      analysis.
PG  - 1855-62
AB  - Practical and theoretically sound methods for analyzing innovative environmental 
      technologies are needed to inform public and private decisions regarding research 
      and development, risk management, and stakeholder communication. By integrating 
      scientific assessments with a characterization of values, multicriteria decision 
      analysis (MCDA) supports the ranking of alternative technology pathways on the 
      basis of technical, financial, and social concerns. We applied MCDAto evaluate 
      the use of NoMix urine separating toilets for managing environmental risk and 
      postponing expensive upgrades to a large wastewater treatment plant near Zürich, 
      Switzerland. Results indicate that, given current priorities, no single, fixed 
      course of action (including the status quo) will be desirable to all stakeholders 
      over the considered time horizon. However, a path forward is suggested that is 
      not significantly disadvantageous to any stakeholder now and leaves open future 
      options, allowing society to achieve overall greater benefits if priorities 
      change, new environmental risks are revealed, or technology improves. While our 
      analysis focuses on a particular catchment in Switzerland, many communities 
      worldwide are faced with an aging and inefficient wastewater treatment 
      infrastructure while also experiencing growth and development. Our framework can 
      help these communities balance the conflicting objectives of diverse stakeholders
